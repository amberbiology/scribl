  scribl (Semantic Capture of Relationships in Biological Literature) is a
  Python software pipeline and API that transforms a Zotero literature database
  with entries annotated with tags in the **scribl** language to create a graph
  data structure, suitable for import into a graph database platform, such as
  Neo4j or Python's NetworkX. The scribl language was designed for the curation
  from scientific articles, to capture the relationships between the various
  biological agents and the processes that they describe in a connected network.
