  "description": "<p>scribl (Semantic Capture of Relationships in Biological Literature) is a Python software pipeline and API that transforms a <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/\">Zotero</a> literature database with entries annotated with tags in the **scribl** language to create a graph data structure, suitable for import into a graph database platform, such as <a href=\"https://neo4j.com\">Neo4j</a>, or Python's <a href=\"https://networkx.org/\">NetworkX</a></p>. The scribl language was designed for the curation from scientific articles, to capture the relationships between the various biological agents and the processes that they describe in a connected network.",
