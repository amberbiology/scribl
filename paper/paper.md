# Summary

In systems biology research, utilizing literature databasesÂ involves
more than simple keyword queries for biological agents (e.g.,
proteins, genes, compounds, receptor complexes) and processes (e.g,
autophagy, cell cycle) [@krallinger_linking_2008], which typically only 
return lists of articles. Advanced methods are necessary for extracting 
and visualizing the relationships detailed within these documents 
[@cary_pathway_2005; @suderman_tools_2007; @pavlopoulos_visualizing_2015].
Here, we introduce a system that supports the annotation of scientific
articles and represents and visualizes these relationships. This
system, `scribl`, consists of two parts: (1) a simple syntax that can
be used to curate the biological relationships described within the text of
those articles, (2) a Python software API and pipeline that can
transform a [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) literature database,
with entries annotated with this syntax, into a database suitable for
graph-based relationship queries.

# The `scribl` language

![The `scribl` schema comprises five basic entities: `article`, `category`, `resource`, `process`, and `agent`. Here we depict an example network of entities and possible relationships for a single `article`.\label{fig:scribl-schema}](scribl-schema.png){ width=100% }

The language was designed for the curation of scientific articles to
document the relationships between biological agents and processes
that they describe. Examples of relationships for each of the five
basic entities for a single article are shown in
\autoref{fig:scribl-schema}.

A curator can add `scribl` statements as tags to each article
in a literature database, to represent aspects of the causal relationships
that are described in the article.

|   |
|:--|
| `::agent c9orf72 :gene :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96LT7`     |
| `::agent gtp :tag nucleoside, purine, nucleoside triphosphate`                   |
| `::process exportin releases cargo into cytoplasm @ exportin-1`                  |
| `::process smcr8 mutation > ulk1 phosphorylation < autophagy = smcr8 expression` |
: Example `scribl` statements included in Zotero tags\label{scribl-examples}

\autoref{scribl-examples} shows two types of entities: (1) agents
(`::agent`): are actual biochemical entities (e.g. proteins) described
in the literature article in question, along with some metadata about
the agent, (2) processes (`::process`) which represent broad
mechanistic, or phenomenological biological processes (e.g.,
`autophagy`).

# The `scribl` Python package

The `scribl` Python package provides an API to query a [Zotero](https://zotero.org)
database where each literature record has been annotated using
declarative statements in the `scribl` syntax described in
\autoref{scribl-examples}. Currently, the literature source for
`scribl` input can be either a remote Zotero database, or a file
export from a local Zotero installation. Once the Zotero data has been
parsed, the resulting graph data structure can then be exported for
use in graph database platforms. `scribl` also supports the
incremental updating of the graph database as new Zotero entries come
in (\autoref{fig:scribl-workflow}).

![Two major workflows for the `scribl` software: creating a new graph database (left) and updating an existing one (right). The workflow contains a step that identifies possible syntactic errors in `scribl` statements so that they can be fixed in the Zotero database before database generation. Note that "Zotero csv export" could be replaced by a query to a remote Zotero library  \label{fig:scribl-workflow}](scribl-workflow.png){ width=104% }

`scribl` functions can be accessed programmatically by writing a
Python script that calls the `scribl` API, or via the included
command-line program `scribl`.

`scribl` currently supports output in one of two graph formats:

1. [Cypher query language](https://opencypher.org/)
   [@francis_cypher_2018] used by the graph database platform
   [neo4j](https://neo4j.com). The output Cypher query text can be
   used directly to initialize a Neo4j database.  The Neo4j setup
   itself is not automated by `scribl` and must be installed
   separately.

2. [GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) [@brandes_graphml_2002]
   format that can be read and used for processing and visualization
   by packages such as Python's [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
   [@hagberg_exploring_2008]. The `scribl` command-line program can
   generate visualizations (e.g, \autoref{fig:graph-networkx}) from
   GraphML output, and from an input Zotero file in CSV format
   directly, a basic example of which is shown below:

   ``` shell
   scribl -g new_graphdb -z zotero.csv --networkx-fig graphdb-visual.png
   ```

![NetworkX visualization of a graph database exported as GraphML, generated directly by `scribl`.\label{fig:graph-networkx}](../graphdb-visual.png){ width=75% }

Once a graph database has been created, it can be queried with prompts that go beyond the capabilities of 
traditional keyword searches. For example, once the
`scribl` output is loaded into a Neo4j database, it is possible to write
Cypher queries such as: "Show me all of the agents that are
involved in the process `nuclear export` along with the articles that describe
them".

# Statement of need

### Why `scribl`?

The `scribl` platform was developed to fill a need for a simple way to
enable global sharing and collaborative curation of biological
relationships embedded in literature records, and to rapidly translate
those relationships into queryable graph networks. The `scribl` syntax
was designed to be simple to learn, but rich enough to
represent important relationships relevant to molecular and systems
biology.

Zotero was chosen as the initial backend, because it is simple to
install and run, as well as supporting the tagging of literature records and
web-based curation. `scribl` allows a researcher or
group of researchers, to rapidly build and visualize important
relationships useful for understanding the cellular and systems biology
within a chosen subdomain. In fact our main use-case for `scribl` was
the building of a relationship database of neurodegenerative disease
pathways for the frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) research community.

### What `scribl` is not

`scribl` is not primarily intended for the construction of formal,
kinetic models of biological systems in the way that modeling
languages such as [Kappa](https://kappalanguage.org/)
[@boutillier_kappa_2020] and [SBML](https://sbml.org/)
[@keating_sbml_2020] are. However, these networks can be considered a
coarse-grained model of biological systems that sit somewhere between
low resolution, keyword-based representations; and high resolution,
formal, kinetic models. `scribl`-enabled networks may also help
researchers identify interactions or parameters that require
measurement in order to build those detailed models, and in-principle,
`scribl` could be extended to directly generate models in Kappa or
SBML format for the subset of entries with sufficient kinetic
annotations to form a self-contained network.

`scribl` is also not intended to be a replacement for an interactive
visualization engine such as [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/)
[@shannon_cytoscape_2003], in fact there are plugins to Cytoscape that
allow the import of both the Neo4j and GraphML formats that `scribl`
produces. Nor is it a substitute for biological graph databases such
as [Reactome](https://reactome.org) [@gillespie_reactome_2022]. The
Reactome database is actually based upon the Neo4j graph database
engine, so `scribl` could actually help facilitate the curation of
biological pathways from newly-published literature, in a format that
is ready for graph data repositories like Reactome.

# Availability

`scribl` is available as a package on PyPI with the source code and
