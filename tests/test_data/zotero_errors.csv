Recent Findings: Advances in clinical phenotyping, genetics, and biomarkers have enabled improved predictions of the specific underlying molecular pathology associated with different presentations of FTD. Evaluation of large international cohorts has led to recent refinements in diagnostic criteria for several of the FTD subtypes. Summary: The FTDs are a group of neurodegenerative disorders featuring progressive deterioration of behavior or language and associated pathology in the frontal or temporal lobes. Based on anatomic, genetic, and neuropathologic categorizations, the six clinical subtypes of FTD or related disorders are: (1) behavioral variant of FTD, (2) semantic variant primary progressive aphasia, (3) nonfluent agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia, (4) corticobasal syndrome, (5) progressive supranuclear palsy, and (6) FTD associated with motor neuron disease. Recognition and accurate diagnoses of FTD subtypes will aid the neurologist in the management of patients with FTD.",2016-04,2021-10-26 17:19:43,2021-12-08 15:26:48,2021-10-20 14:44:26,464-489,,2 Dementia,22,,Continuum (Minneap Minn),,,,,,,,en-US,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 27042904 PMCID: PMC5390934,,/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/2B7ZUTDD/Finger - 2016 - Frontotemporal Dementias.pdf; ; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/EUIQIFC5/Frontotemporal_Dementias.10.html,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5390934/,::category biomarkers; ::category c9orf72 pathology; ::category clinical; ::category mapt/tau pathology; ::category progranulin pathology; ::category tdp-43 aggregation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated the role of exosomes in the secretion and propagation of TDP-43 aggregates. TDP-43 was detected in secreted exosomes from Neuro2a cells and primary neurons but not from astrocytes or microglia. Evidence is presented that protein aggregation and autophagy inhibition are factors that promote exosomal secretion of TDP-43. We also report that levels of exosomal TDP-43 full length and C-terminal fragment species are upregulated in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains. Exposure of Neuro2a cells to exosomes from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brain, but not from control brain, caused cytoplasmic redistribution of TDP-43, suggesting that secreted exosomes might contribute to propagation of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Yet, inhibition of exosome secretion by inactivation of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 with GW4869 or by silencing RAB27A provoked formation of TDP-43 aggregates in Neuro2a cells. Moreover, administration of GW4869 exacerbated the disease phenotypes of transgenic mice expressing human TDP-43A315T mutant. Thus, even though results suggest that exosomes containing pathological TDP-43 may play a key role in the propagation of TDP-43 proteinopathy, a therapeutic strategy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on inhibition of exosome production would seem inappropriate, as in vivo data suggest that exosome secretion plays an overall beneficial role in neuronal clearance of pathological TDP-43.",2016-12-01,2021-10-26 17:19:43,2021-12-12 23:20:08,2021-10-21 19:35:04,3187-3201,,12,139,,Brain,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/2URE9SA3/Iguchi et al. - 2016 - Exosome secretion is a key pathway for clearance o.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/4AQDT8IQ/2141149.html,,::category ::category ::agent :protein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 causes neuronal dysfunction and death remain unknown. Here, we report distinct cytotoxic effects of full-length TDP-43 (FL-TDP) and its C-terminal fragment (CTF) in SH-SY5Y cells. When FL-TDP was overexpressed in the cells using a lentiviral system, exogenous TDP-43, like endogenous TDP-43, was expressed mainly in nuclei of cells without any intracellular inclusions. However, these cells showed striking cell death, caspase activation and growth arrest at G2/M phase, indicating that even simple overexpression of TDP-43 induces cellular dysfunctions leading to apoptosis. On the other hand, cells expressing TDP-43 CTF showed cytoplasmic aggregates but without significant cell death, compared with cells expressing FL-TDP. Confocal microscopic analyses revealed that RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and several transcription factors, such as specificity protein 1 and cAMP-response-element-binding protein, were co-localized with the aggregates of TDP-43 CTF, suggesting that sequestration of these factors into TDP-43 aggregates caused transcriptional dysregulation. Indeed, accumulation of RNA pol II at TDP-43 inclusions was detected in brains of patients with FTLD-TDP. Furthermore, apoptosis was not observed in affected neurons of FTLD-TDP brains containing phosphorylated and aggregated TDP-43 pathology. Our results suggest that different pathways of TDP-43-induced cellular dysfunction may contribute to the degeneration cascades involved in the onset of ALS and FTLD-TDP.",2014-08-15,2021-10-26 17:19:43,2022-01-23 21:00:44,2021-10-21 17:20:42,4345-4356,,16,23,,Human Molecular Genetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9BBAHVSS/Yamashita et al. - 2014 - Distinct pathways leading to TDP-43-induced cellul.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/2JHTGFSP/627735.html,,::agent caspase-1 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29466; ::agent creb1 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P16220; ::agent rna-pol2 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P24928; ::agent tardbp :gene :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent tdp-43 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent ubiquitin :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0CG47; ::category als; ::category apoptosis; ::category rna processing; ::category tdp-43 aggregation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that TDP-43 at its endogenous level undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within nuclei in multiple cell types. Increased concentration of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm or transient exposure to sonicated amyloid-like fibrils is shown to provoke long-lived liquid droplets of cytosolic TDP-43 whose assembly and maintenance are independent of conventional stress granules. Cytosolic liquid droplets of TDP-43 accumulate phosphorylated TDP-43 and rapidly convert into gels/solids in response to transient, arsenite-mediated stress. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets slowly recruit importin-Œ± and Nup62 and induce mislocalization of RanGap1, Ran, and Nup107, thereby provoking inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport, clearance of nuclear TDP-43, and cell death.

The mutation appeared to produce both haploinsufficiency and gain-of-function effects in the form of aggregating expanded RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). An unprecedented effort was then unleashed to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms and the functions of C9ORF72 in order to design therapies. A decade later, while the toxicity of accumulating gain-of-function products has been established and therapeutic strategies are being developed to target it, the contribution of the loss of function starts to appear more clearly.

Although disparate in their pathophysiology, many of these disorders share a common theme, manifested in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates in the brain. Recently, the major disease protein found in the pathological inclusions of two of these diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontal temporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), was identified as the 43-kDa TAR‚ÄìDNA-binding protein (TDP-43), providing a molecular link between them. TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that undergoes a pathological conversion to an aggregated cytoplasmic localization in affected regions of the nervous system. Whether TDP-43 itself can convey toxicity and whether its abnormal aggregation is a cause or consequence of pathogenesis remain unknown. We report a yeast model to define mechanisms governing TDP-43 subcellular localization and aggregation. Remarkably, this simple model recapitulates several salient features of human TDP-43 proteinopathies, including conversion from nuclear localization to cytoplasmic aggregation. We establish a connection between this aggregation and toxicity. The pathological features of TDP-43 are distinct from those of yeast models of other protein-misfolding diseases, such as polyglutamine. This suggests that the yeast model reveals specific aspects of the underlying biology of the disease protein rather than general cellular stresses associated with accumulating misfolded proteins. This work provides a mechanistic framework for investigating the toxicity of TDP-43 aggregation relevant to human disease and establishes a manipulable, high-throughput model for discovering potential therapeutic strategies.",2008-04-29,2021-10-26 17:19:42,2022-01-23 20:46:18,2021-10-20 20:01:55,6439-6444,,17,105,,PNAS,A yeast TDP-43 proteinopathy model,,,,,,,en,¬© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA,,,,www.pnas.org,,Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 18434538,,/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/547PN9BK/Johnson et al. - 2008 - A yeast TDP-43 proteinopathy model Exploring the .pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9JUZAUGJ/6439.html;,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434538,::agent alpha-synuclein :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P37840; ::agent tdp-43 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent ubiquitin :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0CG47; ::category als; ::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mammalian RNA decay pathways remain poorly characterized. To provide a framework for studying mammalian RNA decay, a two-hybrid protein interaction map was generated using 54 constructs from 38 human proteins predicted to function in mRNA decay. The results provide evidence for interactions between many different proteins required for mRNA decay. Of particular interest are interactions between the poly(A) ribonuclease and the exosome and between the Lsm complex, decapping factors, and 5‚Ä≤‚Üí3‚Ä≤ exonucleases. Moreover, multiple interactions connect 5‚Ä≤‚Üí3‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤‚Üí5‚Ä≤ decay proteins to each other and to nonsense-mediated decay factors, providing the opportunity for coordination between decay pathways. The interaction network also predicts the internal organization of the exosome and Lsm complexes. Additional interactions connect mRNA decay factors to many novel proteins and to proteins required for other steps in gene expression. These results provide an experimental insight into the organization of proteins required for mRNA decay and their coupling to other cellular processes, and the physiological relevance of many of these interactions are supported by their evolutionary conservation. The interactions also provide a wealth of hypotheses to guide future research on mRNA degradation and demonstrate the power of exhaustive protein interaction mapping in aiding understanding of uncharacterized protein complexes and pathways.",2004-07,2021-10-26 17:19:42,2022-01-23 20:45:57,2021-10-21 19:16:37,1315-1323,,7,14,,Genome Res,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 15231747 PMCID: PMC442147,,/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9CSPNCSK/Lehner and Sanderson - 2004 - A Protein Interaction Framework for Human mRNA Deg.pdf;,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442147/,::agent csl4 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y3B2; ::agent kiaa0052 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15477; ::agent mpp6 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99547; ::agent mtr3 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5RKV6; ::agent oip2 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96B26; ::agent rrp4 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13868; ::agent rrp40 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NQT5; ::agent rrp41 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NPD3; ::agent rrp42 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15024; ::agent rrp44 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y2L1; ::agent rrp46 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NQT4; ::agent scl100 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q01780; ::agent scl75 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q06265; ::category exosomal clearance; ::category rna processing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosomal region candidate gene 8 (SMCR8) is a protein with unclear functions. We report that C9ORF72 is a component of a multiprotein complex containing SMCR8, WDR41, and ATG101 (an important regulator of autophagy). The C9ORF72 complex displays guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and acts as a guanosine diphosphate‚Äìguanosine 5‚Ä≤-triphosphate (GDP-GTP) exchange factor (GEF) for RAB39B. We created Smcr8 knockout mice and found that Smcr8 mutant cells exhibit impaired autophagy induction, which is similarly observed in C9orf72 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, SMCR8/C9ORF72 interacts with the key autophagy initiation ULK1 complex and regulates expression and activity of ULK1. The complex has an additional role in regulating later stages of autophagy. Whereas autophagic flux is enhanced in C9orf72 knockdown cells, depletion of Smcr8 results in a reduced flux with an abnormal expression of lysosomal enzymes. Thus, C9ORF72 and SMCR8 have similar functions in modulating autophagy induction by regulating ULK1 and play distinct roles in regulating autophagic flux.",2016-09-02,2021-10-26 17:19:42,2022-01-23 21:19:41,2021-10-22 19:17:56,e1601167,,9,2,,Sci Adv,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 27617292 PMCID: PMC5010369,,; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/NCTVHR49/Yang et al. - 2016 - A C9ORF72SMCR8-containing complex regulates ULK1 .pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5010369/,::agent atg101 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BSB4 | atg13 | wdr41 | ulk1; ::agent atg13 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75143; ::agent c9orf72 :protein :gene :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96LT7 | c9orf72 complex | smcr8 | rab39b; ::agent c9orf72 complex :complex | ulk1 complex; ::agent cathepsin l :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07711; ::agent lc3 :protein :biomarker  :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZQ8; ::agent lc3i :protein :biomarker :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZQ8; ::agent lc3ii :protein :biomarker :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZQ8; ::agent mtor :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P42345 | rapamycin; ::agent procathepsin l :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07711; ::agent rab39b :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96DA2; ::agent rapamycin :url https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5284616; ::agent smcr8 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8TEV9; ::agent ulk1 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75385 | atg13 | ulk1 complex :syn  atg1; ::agent ulk1 complex :complex; ::agent wdr41 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9HAD4; ::category autophagy; ::category c9orf72 pathology; ::category genetics; ::category lysosomal clearance; ::process autophagosome formation @ ulk1 complex @ ulk1; ::process autophagy @ ulk1 complex ~ ulk1; ::process c9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion; ::process c9orf72 knockout < ulk1 phosphorylation > procathepsin l expression > autophagy; ::process c9orf72 mutation > c9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion; ::process cell starvation > interaction of c9orf72 complex and ulk1 complex; ::process interaction of c9orf72 complex and ulk1 complex @ ulk1 complex @ c9orf72 complex; ::process lc3 processing @ lc3 + lc3i + lc3ii; ::process lysosomal protein degradation @ cathepsin l; ::process mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy @ mtor < autophagy; ::process phagophore recruits atg proteins > autophagosome formation @ atg101 @ atg13; ::process procathepsin l expression + procathepsin l; ::process procathepsin l processing @ procathepsin l + cathepsin l; ::process regulation of ulk1 expression @ ulk1 = ulk1 expression; ::process smcr8 expression  + smcr8; ::process smcr8 knockout < smcr8 expression < autophagosome formation < lysosomal protein degradation > lc3 processing; ::process smcr8 mutation > ulk1 phosphorylation < autophagy = smcr8 expression; ::process ulk1 expression + ulk1; ::process ulk1 phosphorylation < autophagy @ ulk1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ALS and FTLD-U, aggregated, ubiquitinated, and N-terminally truncated TDP-43 can be isolated from brain tissue rich in neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The loss of TDP-43 function resulting from inappropriate cleavage, translocation from the nucleus, or its sequestration into inclusions could play important roles in neurodegeneration. However, it is not known whether TDP-43 fragments directly mediate toxicity and, more specifically, whether their abnormal aggregation is a cause or consequence of pathogenesis. We report that the ectopic expression of a ‚âà25-kDa TDP-43 fragment corresponding to the C-terminal truncation product of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 leads to the formation of toxic, insoluble, and ubiquitin- and phospho-positive cytoplasmic inclusions within cells. The 25-kDa C-terminal fragment is more prone to phosphorylation at S409/S410 than full-length TDP-43, but phosphorylation at these sites is not required for inclusion formation or toxicity. Although this fragment shows no biological activity, its exogenous expression neither inhibits the function nor causes the sequestration of full-length nuclear TDP-43, suggesting that the 25-kDa fragment can induce cell death through a toxic gain-of-function. Finally, by generating a conformation-dependent antibody that detects C-terminal fragments, we show that this toxic cleavage product is specific for pathologic inclusions in human TDP-43 proteinopathies.",2009-05-05,2021-10-26 20:20:27,2022-01-23 20:46:34,2021-10-26 20:20:27,7607-7612,,18,106,,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,,,,,,,,,,,,PubMed Central,,PMID: 19383787 PMCID: PMC2671323,,; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/ENKUU5V2/Zhang et al. - 2009 - Aberrant cleavage of TDP-43 enhances aggregation a.pdf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671323/,::agent  caspase-1 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29466; ::agent  tau :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636; ::agent mapt  :gene :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636; ::agent tardbp :gene :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent tdp-43 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::category als; ::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increasing number of genetic causes of ALS are being identified, but how these genetic defects lead to motor neuron degeneration and to which extent they affect common cellular pathways remains incompletely understood. To address these questions, we performed an interactomic analysis to identify binding partners of wild-type (WT) and ALS-associated mutant versions of ATXN2, C9orf72, FUS, OPTN, TDP-43 and UBQLN2 in neuronal cells. This analysis identified several known but also many novel binding partners of these proteins. Interactomes of WT and mutant ALS proteins were very similar except for OPTN and UBQLN2, in which mutations caused loss or gain of protein interactions. Several of the identified interactomes showed a high degree of overlap: shared binding partners of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43 had roles in RNA metabolism; OPTN- and UBQLN2-interacting proteins were related to protein degradation and protein transport, and C9orf72 interactors function in mitochondria. To confirm that this overlap is important for ALS pathogenesis, we studied fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), one of the common interactors of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43, in more detail in in vitro and in vivo model systems for FUS ALS. FMRP localized to mutant FUS-containing aggregates in spinal motor neurons and bound endogenous FUS in a direct and RNA-sensitive manner. Furthermore, defects in synaptic FMRP mRNA target expression, neuromuscular junction integrity, and motor behavior caused by mutant FUS in zebrafish embryos, could be rescued by exogenous FMRP expression. Together, these results show that interactomics analysis can provide crucial insight into ALS disease mechanisms and they link FMRP to motor neuron dysfunction caused by FUS mutations.",2016-08,2021-11-15 16:58:12,2022-01-23 20:56:25,,175-196,,2,132,,Acta Neuropathol,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,PubMed,,PMID: 27164932 PMCID: PMC4947123,,; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/ZVEYQHBU/Blokhuis et al. - 2016 - Comparative interactomics analysis of different AL.pdf,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164932,::agent atxn2 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99700; ::agent c9orf72 :protein :gene :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96LT7; ::agent fmrp :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q06787; ::agent fus :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P35637; ::agent optn :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96CV9; ::agent tardbp :gene :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent tdp-43 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent ubqln2 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UHD9; ::category als; ::category fus pathology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism by which the UBQLN2 mutations cause disease remains unclear. Alterations in proteins involved in autophagy are prominent in neuronal tissue of human ALS UBQLN2 patients and in a transgenic P497S UBQLN2 mouse model of ALS/FTD, suggesting a pathogenic link. Here, we show UBQLN2 functions in autophagy and that ALS/FTD mutant proteins compromise this function. Inactivation of UBQLN2 expression in HeLa cells reduced autophagic flux and autophagosome acidification. The defect in acidification was rescued by reexpression of wild type (WT) UBQLN2 but not by any of the five different UBQLN2 ALS/FTD mutants tested. Proteomic analysis and immunoblot studies revealed P497S mutant mice and UBQLN2 knockout HeLa and NSC34 cells have reduced expression of ATP6v1g1, a critical subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) pump. Knockout of UBQLN2 expression in HeLa cells decreased turnover of ATP6v1g1, while overexpression of WT UBQLN2 increased biogenesis of ATP6v1g1 compared with P497S mutant UBQLN2 protein. In vitro interaction studies showed that ATP6v1g1 binds more strongly to WT UBQLN2 than to ALS/FTD mutant UBQLN2 proteins. Intriguingly, overexpression of ATP6v1g1 in UBQLN2 knockout HeLa cells increased autophagosome acidification, suggesting a therapeutic approach to overcome the acidification defect. Taken together, our findings suggest that UBQLN2 mutations drive pathogenesis through a dominant-negative loss-of-function mechanism in autophagy and that UBQLN2 functions as an important regulator of the expression and stability of ATP6v1g1. These findings may have important implications for devising therapies to treat UBQLN2-linked ALS/FTD.",2020-06-30,2021-11-15 17:58:54,2022-01-23 20:47:35,2021-11-15 17:58:54,15230-15241,,26,117,,PNAS,,,,,,,,en,¬© 2020 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.,,,,www.pnas.org,,Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 32513711,,/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/VGKJU6GI/Wu et al. - 2020 - ALSFTD mutations in UBQLN2 impede autophagy by re.pdf; ; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/PJ2M9EXA/15230.html,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513711,::agent atp6v1g1 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75348; ::agent mtor :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P42345; ::agent sqstm1 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13501; ::agent ubqln2 :protein :url https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UHD9; ::category als; ::category autophagy; ::process atp6v1g1 expression > autophagosome acidification + atp6v1g1; ::process autophagosome acidification > autophagy; ::process autophagosome formation; ::process autophagy; ::process binding of atp6v1g1 and ubqln2 @ atp6v1g1 @ ubqln2; ::process chaperone-mediated folding of atp6v1g1 + atp6v1g1; ::process formation of ubqln2 inclusions @ ubqln2 > p62 co-localizes with ubqln2; ::process inhibition of ubqln2 expression < mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy < atp6v1g1 expression < autophagosome formation < ubqln2 expression; ::process lysosomal protein degradation; ::process mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy @ mtor < autophagy; ::process p62 co-localizes with ubqln2 @ sqstm1 @ ubqln2; ::process ubqln2 expression + ubqln2 > autophagosome formation; ::process ubqln2 mutation < mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy < autophagosome formation < atp6v1g1 expression < binding of atp6v1g1 and ubqln2 > formation of ubqln2 inclusions = ubqln2 expression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
