Downregulation of Znf179 has been observed in motor neurons of adult mouse models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), yet the molecular function of Znf179 in neurodegeneration has never been previously described. Znf179 contains the classical C3HC4 RING finger domain, and numerous proteins containing C3HC4 RING finger domain act as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Hence, we are interested to identify whether Znf179 possesses E3 ligase activity and its role in ALS neuropathy. Methods We used in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assay to examine the E3 ligase autoubiquitination activity of Znf179 and its effect on 26S proteasome activity. To search for the candidate substrates of Znf179, we immunoprecipitated Znf179 and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis to identify its interacting proteins. We found that ALS/ FTLD-U (frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin inclusions)-related neurodegenerative TDP-43 protein is the E3 ligase substrate of Znf179. To further clarify the role of E3 ubiquitin ligase Znf179 in neurodegenerative TDP-43-UBI (ubiquitinated inclusions) (+) proteinopathy, the effect of Znf179-mediated TDP-43 polyubiquitination on TDP-43 protein stability, aggregate formation and nucleus/cytoplasm mislocalization were evaluated in vitro cell culture system and in vivo animal model. Results Here we report that Znf179 is a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase which possesses autoubiquitination feature and regulates 26S proteasome activity through modulating the protein expression levels of 19S/20S proteasome subunits. Our immunoprecipitation assay and MS analysis results revealed that the neuropathological TDP-43 protein is one of its E3 ligase substrate. Znf179 interactes with TDP-43 protein and mediates polyubiquitination of TDP-43 in vitro and in vivo. In neurodegenerative TDP-43 proteinopathy, we found that Znf179-mediated polyubiquitination of TDP-43 accelerates its protein turnover rate and attenuates insoluble pathologic TDP-43 aggregates, while knockout of Znf179 in mouse brain results in accumulation of insoluble TDP-43 and cytosolic TDP-43 inclusions in cortex, hippocampus and midbrain regions. Conclusions Here we unveil the important role for the novel E3 ligase Znf179 in TDP-43-mediated neuropathy, and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for combating ALS/ FTLD-U neurodegenerative pathologies.

We have generated transgenic (TDP-43PrP) mice expressing full-length human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) driven by the mouse prion promoter to provide a tool to analyze the role of wild-type hTDP-43 in the brain and spinal cord. Expression of hTDP-43 caused a dose-dependent downregulation of mouse TDP-43 RNA and protein. Moderate overexpression of hTDP-43 resulted in TDP-43 truncation, increased cytoplasmic and nuclear ubiquitin levels, and intranuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates that were immunopositive for phosphorylated TDP-43. Of note, abnormal juxtanuclear aggregates of mitochondria were observed, accompanied by enhanced levels of Fis1 and phosphorylated DLP1, key components of the mitochondrial fission machinery. Conversely, a marked reduction in mitofusin 1 expression, which plays an essential role in mitochondrial fusion, was observed in TDP-43PrP mice. Finally, TDP-43PrP mice showed reactive gliosis, axonal and myelin degeneration, gait abnormalities, and early lethality.

Despite the importance of TBI in ALS progression, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still an enigma. Here, we examined the contribution of TBI as an extrinsic factor and investigated whether TBI influences the susceptibility of developing neurodegenerative symptoms. To evaluate the effects of TBI in vivo, we applied mild to severe trauma to Drosophila and found that TBI leads to the induction of stress granules (SGs) in the brain. The degree of SGs induction directly correlates with the level of trauma. Furthermore, we observed that the level of mortality is directly proportional to the number of traumatic hits. Interestingly, trauma-induced SGs are ubiquitin, p62 and TDP-43 positive, and persistently remain over time suggesting that SGs might be aggregates and exert toxicity in our fly models. Intriguingly, TBI on animals expressing ALS-linked genes increased mortality and locomotion dysfunction suggesting that mild trauma might aggravate neurodegenerative symptoms associated with ALS. Furthermore, we found elevated levels of high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins and p62 in animals expressing ALS-causing genes with TBI, suggesting that TBI may lead to the defects in protein degradation pathways. Finally, we observed that genetic and pharmacological induction of autophagy enhanced the clearance of SGs and promoted survival of flies in vivo. Together, our study demonstrates that trauma can induce SG formation in vivo and might enhance neurodegenerative phenotypes in the fly models of ALS.","2018-04-15","2021-10-26 17:19:49","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-22 19:10:14","1366-1381","","8","27","","Human Molecular Genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/QAZD2F4B/Anderson et al. - 2018 - Traumatic injury induces stress granule formation .pdf","","::category neuroinflammation; ::category stress granules; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the molecular mechanism that controls the inhibitory effect of mTOR on ULK1-mediated autophagy is not fully understood. Here we identified AMPK, a central energy sensor, as a new ULK1-binding partner. We found that AMPK binds to the PS domain of ULK1 and this interaction is required for ULK1-mediated autophagy. Interestingly, activation of AMPK by AICAR induces 14-3-3 binding to the AMPK-ULK1-mTORC1 complex, which coincides with raptor Ser792 phosphorylation and mTOR inactivation. Consistently, AICAR induces autophagy in TSC2-deficient cells expressing wild-type raptor but not the mutant raptor that lacks the AMPK phosphorylation sites (Ser722 and Ser792). Taken together, these results suggest that AMPK association with ULK1 plays an important role in autophagy induction, at least in part, by phosphorylation of raptor to lift the inhibitory effect of mTOR on the ULK1 autophagic complex.","2010-11-03","2021-10-26 17:19:48","2021-12-08 14:39:51","2021-10-21 20:42:40","e15394","","11","5","","PLoS One","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 21072212 PMCID: PMC2972217","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/HDRQUCI8/Lee et al. - 2010 - The Association of AMPK with ULK1 Regulates Autoph.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2972217/","::category autophagy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The RNA-binding properties of TDP-43 are essential for the autoregulatory activity through binding to 3′ UTR sequences in its own mRNA. Our analysis indicated that the C-terminal region of TDP-43, which mediates TDP-43–hnRNP interactions, is also required for self-regulation. TDP-43 binding to its 3′ UTR does not significantly change the pre-mRNA splicing pattern but promotes RNA instability.

We observed that the lysosomal fusion machinery and the endolysosomal pathway, which are crucial for proper lysosomal function, were pivotal for survival of cells exposed to TDP-43. Interestingly, TDP-43 itself interfered with these critical TDP-43 clearance pathways. In contrast, autophagy played a complex role in this process. It contributed to the degradation of TDP-43 in the absence of endolysosomal pathway activity, but its induction also enhanced cell death.

Using an HTS-based splicing junction analysis we identified at least six bona fide splicing events that are consistent with being controlled by TDP-43. Validation of the data, both in neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines demonstrated that TDP-43 substantially alters the levels of isoform expression in four genes potentially important for neuropathology: MADD/IG20, STAG2, FNIP1 and BRD8.

Neurochem. (2011) 116, 248–259. Abstract TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Phosphorylated and ubiquitinated TDP-43 C-terminal fragments have been found in cytoplasmic inclusions in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. However, the factors and pathways that regulate TDP-43 aggregation are still not clear. We found that the C-terminal 15 kDa fragment of TDP-43 is sufficient to induce aggregation but the aggregation phenotype is modified by additional sequences. Aggregation is accompanied by phosphorylation at serine residues 409/410. Mutation of 409/410 to phosphomimetic aspartic acid residues significantly reduces aggregation. Inhibition of either proteasome or autophagy dramatically increases TDP-43 aggregation. Furthermore, TDP-43 aggregates colocalize with markers of autophagy and the adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1. Over-expression of p62/SQSTM1 reduces TDP-43 aggregation in an autophagy and proteasome-dependent manner. These studies suggest that aggregation of TDP-43 C-terminal fragments is regulated by phosphorylation events and both the autophagy and proteasome-mediated degradation pathways.","2011","2021-10-26 17:19:46","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-20 19:47:05","248-259","","2","116","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.07098.x","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/QQB9MWR8/Brady et al. - 2011 - Regulation of TDP-43 aggregation by phosphorylatio.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/DT928S2H/j.1471-4159.2010.07098.html","","::category autophagy; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Haploinsufficiency caused by autosomal dominant mutations within the GRN gene leads to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a progressive neuronal atrophy that presents in patients as frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is an early onset form of dementia, distinct from Alzheimer’s disease. The GRN-related form of frontotemporal lobar dementia is a proteinopathy characterized by the appearance of neuronal inclusions containing ubiquitinated and fragmented TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP). The neurotrophic and neuro-immunomodulatory properties of progranulin have recently been reported but are still not well understood. Gene delivery of GRN in experimental models of Alzheimer’s- and Parkinson’s-like diseases inhibits phenotype progression.

Results Challenges exist for conducting clinical trials in FTLD. Two of the greatest challenges are (1) the heterogeneity of FTLD syndromes leading to difficulties in efficiently measuring treatment effects and (2) the rarity of FTLD disorders leading to recruitment challenges. Discussion New personalized endpoints that are clinically meaningful to individuals and their families should be developed. Personalized approaches to analyzing MRI data, development of new fluid biomarkers and wearable technologies will help to improve the power to detect treatment effects in FTLD clinical trials and enable new, clinical trial designs, possibly leveraged from the experience of oncology trials.

A large proportion of FTD patients (35-50%) have a family history of dementia, consistent with a strong genetic component to the disease. In 1998, mutations in the gene encoding the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) were shown to cause familial FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17q21 (FTDP-17). The neuropathology of patients with defined MAPT mutations is characterized by cytoplasmic neurofibrillary inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. However, in multiple FTD families with significant evidence for linkage to the same region on chromosome 17q21 (D17S1787-D17S806), mutations in MAPT have not been found and the patients consistently lack tau-immunoreactive inclusion pathology. In contrast, these patients have ubiquitin (ub)-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and characteristic lentiform ub-immunoreactive neuronal intranuclear inclusions. Here we demonstrate that in these families, FTD is caused by mutations in progranulin (PGRN) that are likely to create null alleles. PGRN is located 1.7 Mb centromeric of MAPT on chromosome 17q21.31 and encodes a 68.5-kDa secreted growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes including development, wound repair and inflammation. PGRN has also been strongly linked to tumorigenesis. Moreover, PGRN expression is increased in activated microglia in many neurodegenerative diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease. Our results identify mutations in PGRN as a cause of neurodegenerative disease and indicate the importance of PGRN function for neuronal survival.","2006-08-24","2021-10-26 17:19:44","2021-12-08 14:50:17","","916-919","","7105","442","","Nature","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16862116","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16862116","::category genetics; ::category neuroinflammation; ::category progranulin pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The causes for neuropathological TDP-43 aggregation are unknown, but it has been suggested that stress granule (SG) formation is important in this process. Indeed, in human embryonic kidney HEK293E cells, various SG-forming conditions induced very strong TDP-43 ubiquitylation, insolubility, and reduced splicing activity. Osmotic stress–induced SG formation and TDP-43 ubiquitylation occurred rapidly and coincided with colocalization of TDP-43 and SG markers. Washout experiments confirmed the rapid dissolution of SGs, accompanied by normalization of TDP-43 ubiquitylation and solubility. Surprisingly, interference with the SG process using a protein kinase R–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase inhibitor (GSK2606414) or the translation blocker emetine did not prevent TDP-43 ubiquitylation and insolubility. Thus, parallel pathways may lead to pathological TDP-43 modifications independent of SG formation. Using a panel of kinase inhibitors targeting signaling pathways of the osmotic shock inducer sorbitol, we could largely rule out the stress-activated and extracellular signal–regulated protein kinase modules and glycogen synthase kinase 3β. For arsenite, but not for sorbitol, quenching oxidative stress with N-acetylcysteine did suppress both SG formation and TDP-43 ubiquitylation and insolubility. Thus, sodium arsenite appears to promote SG formation and TDP-43 modifications via oxidative stress, but sorbitol stimulates TDP-43 ubiquitylation and insolubility via a novel pathway(s) independent of SG formation. In conclusion, pathological TDP-43 modifications can be mediated via multiple distinct pathways for which SGs are not essential.","2020-01-17","2021-10-26 17:19:44","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-21 15:40:09","673-689","","3","295","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 31780563 PMCID: PMC6970928","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/KF6X64CZ/Hans et al. - 2020 - Multiple distinct pathways lead to hyperubiquityla.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970928/","::category stress granules; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we investigated the role of exosomes in the secretion and propagation of TDP-43 aggregates.

Evidence is presented that protein aggregation and autophagy inhibition are factors that promote exosomal secretion of TDP-43. We also report that levels of exosomal TDP-43 full length and C-terminal fragment species are upregulated in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brains. Exposure of Neuro2a cells to exosomes from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis brain, but not from control brain, caused cytoplasmic redistribution of TDP-43, suggesting that secreted exosomes might contribute to propagation of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Yet, inhibition of exosome secretion by inactivation of neutral sphingomyelinase 2 with GW4869 or by silencing RAB27A provoked formation of TDP-43 aggregates in Neuro2a cells. Moreover, administration of GW4869 exacerbated the disease phenotypes of transgenic mice expressing human TDP-43A315T mutant. Thus, even though results suggest that exosomes containing pathological TDP-43 may play a key role in the propagation of TDP-43 proteinopathy, a therapeutic strategy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on inhibition of exosome production would seem inappropriate, as in vivo data suggest that exosome secretion plays an overall beneficial role in neuronal clearance of pathological TDP-43.","2016-12-01","2021-10-26 17:19:43","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-21 19:35:04","3187-3201","","12","139","","Brain","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/2URE9SA3/Iguchi et al. - 2016 - Exosome secretion is a key pathway for clearance o.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/4AQDT8IQ/2141149.html","","::category autophagy; ::category exosomal clearance; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the decision process that moves a cell from autophagy to apoptosis is important since abnormal regulation of autophagy occurs in many diseases, including cancer. To integrate existing knowledge about this decision process into a rigorous, analytical framework, we built a mathematical model of cell fate decisions mediated by autophagy.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which TDP-43 causes neuronal dysfunction and death remain unknown. Here, we report distinct cytotoxic effects of full-length TDP-43 (FL-TDP) and its C-terminal fragment (CTF) in SH-SY5Y cells. When FL-TDP was overexpressed in the cells using a lentiviral system, exogenous TDP-43, like endogenous TDP-43, was expressed mainly in nuclei of cells without any intracellular inclusions. However, these cells showed striking cell death, caspase activation and growth arrest at G2/M phase, indicating that even simple overexpression of TDP-43 induces cellular dysfunctions leading to apoptosis. On the other hand, cells expressing TDP-43 CTF showed cytoplasmic aggregates but without significant cell death, compared with cells expressing FL-TDP. Confocal microscopic analyses revealed that RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and several transcription factors, such as specificity protein 1 and cAMP-response-element-binding protein, were co-localized with the aggregates of TDP-43 CTF, suggesting that sequestration of these factors into TDP-43 aggregates caused transcriptional dysregulation. Indeed, accumulation of RNA pol II at TDP-43 inclusions was detected in brains of patients with FTLD-TDP. Furthermore, apoptosis was not observed in affected neurons of FTLD-TDP brains containing phosphorylated and aggregated TDP-43 pathology. Our results suggest that different pathways of TDP-43-induced cellular dysfunction may contribute to the degeneration cascades involved in the onset of ALS and FTLD-TDP.","2014-08-15","2021-10-26 17:19:43","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-21 17:20:42","4345-4356","","16","23","","Human Molecular Genetics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9BBAHVSS/Yamashita et al. - 2014 - Distinct pathways leading to TDP-43-induced cellul.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/2JHTGFSP/627735.html","","::category apoptosis; ::category rna processing; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent ubiquitin PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0CG47; ::agent tardbp GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent creb1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P16220; ::agent rna-pol2 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P24928; ::agent caspase-1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29466; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we show that TDP-43 at its endogenous level undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) within nuclei in multiple cell types. Increased concentration of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm or transient exposure to sonicated amyloid-like fibrils is shown to provoke long-lived liquid droplets of cytosolic TDP-43 whose assembly and maintenance are independent of conventional stress granules. Cytosolic liquid droplets of TDP-43 accumulate phosphorylated TDP-43 and rapidly convert into gels/solids in response to transient, arsenite-mediated stress. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 droplets slowly recruit importin-α and Nup62 and induce mislocalization of RanGap1, Ran, and Nup107, thereby provoking inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport, clearance of nuclear TDP-43, and cell death.

Patients are first diagnosed with PPA and are then divided into clinical variants based on specific speech and language features characteristic of each subtype. Classification can then be further specified as “imaging-supported” if the expected pattern of atrophy is found and “with definite pathology” if pathologic or genetic data are available. The working recommendations are presented in lists of features, and suggested assessment tasks are also provided.

The mutation appeared to produce both haploinsufficiency and gain-of-function effects in the form of aggregating expanded RNAs and dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). An unprecedented effort was then unleashed to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms and the functions of C9ORF72 in order to design therapies. A decade later, while the toxicity of accumulating gain-of-function products has been established and therapeutic strategies are being developed to target it, the contribution of the loss of function starts to appear more clearly. This article reviews the current knowledge about the C9ORF72 protein, how it is affected by the repeat expansion in models and patients, and what could be the contribution of its haploinsufficiency to the disease in light of the most recent findings.

Although disparate in their pathophysiology, many of these disorders share a common theme, manifested in the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates in the brain. Recently, the major disease protein found in the pathological inclusions of two of these diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontal temporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), was identified as the 43-kDa TAR–DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), providing a molecular link between them. TDP-43 is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that undergoes a pathological conversion to an aggregated cytoplasmic localization in affected regions of the nervous system. Whether TDP-43 itself can convey toxicity and whether its abnormal aggregation is a cause or consequence of pathogenesis remain unknown. We report a yeast model to define mechanisms governing TDP-43 subcellular localization and aggregation. Remarkably, this simple model recapitulates several salient features of human TDP-43 proteinopathies, including conversion from nuclear localization to cytoplasmic aggregation. We establish a connection between this aggregation and toxicity. The pathological features of TDP-43 are distinct from those of yeast models of other protein-misfolding diseases, such as polyglutamine. This suggests that the yeast model reveals specific aspects of the underlying biology of the disease protein rather than general cellular stresses associated with accumulating misfolded proteins. This work provides a mechanistic framework for investigating the toxicity of TDP-43 aggregation relevant to human disease and establishes a manipulable, high-throughput model for discovering potential therapeutic strategies.","2008-04-29","2021-10-26 17:19:42","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-20 20:01:55","6439-6444","","17","105","","PNAS","A yeast TDP-43 proteinopathy model","","","","","","","en","© 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 18434538","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/547PN9BK/Johnson et al. - 2008 - A yeast TDP-43 proteinopathy model Exploring the .pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9JUZAUGJ/6439.html; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18434538","::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent alpha-synuclein PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P37840; ::agent ubiquitin PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P0CG47; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, mammalian RNA decay pathways remain poorly characterized. To provide a framework for studying mammalian RNA decay, a two-hybrid protein interaction map was generated using 54 constructs from 38 human proteins predicted to function in mRNA decay. The results provide evidence for interactions between many different proteins required for mRNA decay. Of particular interest are interactions between the poly(A) ribonuclease and the exosome and between the Lsm complex, decapping factors, and 5′→3′ exonucleases. Moreover, multiple interactions connect 5′→3′ and 3′→5′ decay proteins to each other and to nonsense-mediated decay factors, providing the opportunity for coordination between decay pathways. The interaction network also predicts the internal organization of the exosome and Lsm complexes. Additional interactions connect mRNA decay factors to many novel proteins and to proteins required for other steps in gene expression. These results provide an experimental insight into the organization of proteins required for mRNA decay and their coupling to other cellular processes, and the physiological relevance of many of these interactions are supported by their evolutionary conservation. The interactions also provide a wealth of hypotheses to guide future research on mRNA degradation and demonstrate the power of exhaustive protein interaction mapping in aiding understanding of uncharacterized protein complexes and pathways.","2004-07","2021-10-26 17:19:42","2021-12-20 18:05:16","2021-10-21 19:16:37","1315-1323","","7","14","","Genome Res","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 15231747 PMCID: PMC442147","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9CSPNCSK/Lehner and Sanderson - 2004 - A Protein Interaction Framework for Human mRNA Deg.pdf; ","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC442147/","::category exosomal clearance; ::category rna processing; ::agent csl4 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y3B2; ::agent kiaa0052 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15477; ::agent mpp6 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99547; ::agent mtr3 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q5RKV6; ::agent oip2 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96B26; ::agent rrp4 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13868; ::agent rrp41 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NPD3; ::agent rrp46 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NQT4; ::agent scl100 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q01780; ::agent scl75 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q06265; ::agent rrp42 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q15024; ::agent rrp40 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9NQT5; ::agent rrp44 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9Y2L1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosomal region candidate gene 8 (SMCR8) is a protein with unclear functions. We report that C9ORF72 is a component of a multiprotein complex containing SMCR8, WDR41, and ATG101 (an important regulator of autophagy). The C9ORF72 complex displays guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity and acts as a guanosine diphosphate–guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GDP-GTP) exchange factor (GEF) for RAB39B. We created Smcr8 knockout mice and found that Smcr8 mutant cells exhibit impaired autophagy induction, which is similarly observed in C9orf72 knockdown cells. Mechanistically, SMCR8/C9ORF72 interacts with the key autophagy initiation ULK1 complex and regulates expression and activity of ULK1. The complex has an additional role in regulating later stages of autophagy. Whereas autophagic flux is enhanced in C9orf72 knockdown cells, depletion of Smcr8 results in a reduced flux with an abnormal expression of lysosomal enzymes. Thus, C9ORF72 and SMCR8 have similar functions in modulating autophagy induction by regulating ULK1 and play distinct roles in regulating autophagic flux.","2016-09-02","2021-10-26 17:19:42","2021-12-28 19:07:40","2021-10-22 19:17:56","e1601167","","9","2","","Sci Adv","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 27617292 PMCID: PMC5010369","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/NCTVHR49/Yang et al. - 2016 - A C9ORF72SMCR8-containing complex regulates ULK1 .pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5010369/","::category autophagy; ::category c9orf72 pathology; ::category genetics; ::category lysosomal clearance; ::agent rapamycin https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/5284616; ::agent ulk1 complex COMPLEX; ::agent cathepsin l PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07711; ::agent procathepsin l PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P07711; ::agent rab39b PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96DA2; ::agent smcr8 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8TEV9; ::agent wdr41 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9HAD4; ::process c9orf72 knockout < ulk1 phosphorylation > procathepsin l expression > autophagy; ::process c9orf72 mutation > c9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion; ::process c9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion; ::process cell starvation > interaction of c9orf72 complex and ulk1 complex; ::process autophagosome formation @ ulk1 complex @ ulk1; ::process autophagy @ ulk1 complex; ::process interaction of c9orf72 complex and ulk1 complex @ ulk1 complex @ c9orf72 complex; ::agent atg13 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75143; ::agent lc3i PROTEIN BIOMARKER https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZQ8; ::agent lc3ii PROTEIN BIOMARKER https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZQ8; ::agent lc3 PROTEIN BIOMARKER  https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9GZQ8; ::process lc3 processing @ lc3 + lc3i + lc3ii; ::process lysosomal protein degradation @ cathepsin l; ::process mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy @ mtor < autophagy; ::process phagophore recruits atg proteins > autophagosome formation @ atg101 @ atg13; ::process procathepsin l expression + procathepsin l; ::process procathepsin l processing @ procathepsin l + cathepsin l; ::process ulk1 expression + ulk1; ::process regulation of ulk1 expression @ ulk1 = ulk1 expression; ::agent atg101 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BSB4 | atg13 | wdr41 | ulk1; ::agent c9orf72 complex COMPLEX | ulk1 complex; ::agent mtor PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P42345 | rapamycin; ::process smcr8 knockout < smcr8 expression < autophagosome formation < lysosomal protein degradation > lc3 processing; ::process smcr8 mutation > ulk1 phosphorylation < autophagy = smcr8 expression; ::process smcr8 expression  + smcr8; ::process ulk1 phosphorylation < autophagy @ ulk1; ::agent c9orf72 PROTEIN GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96LT7 | c9orf72 complex | smcr8 | rab39b; ::agent ulk1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75385 | atg13 | ulk1 complex # ulk1 is also known as atg1 $ atg1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In ALS and FTLD-U, aggregated, ubiquitinated, and N-terminally truncated TDP-43 can be isolated from brain tissue rich in neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions. The loss of TDP-43 function resulting from inappropriate cleavage, translocation from the nucleus, or its sequestration into inclusions could play important roles in neurodegeneration. However, it is not known whether TDP-43 fragments directly mediate toxicity and, more specifically, whether their abnormal aggregation is a cause or consequence of pathogenesis. We report that the ectopic expression of a ≈25-kDa TDP-43 fragment corresponding to the C-terminal truncation product of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 leads to the formation of toxic, insoluble, and ubiquitin- and phospho-positive cytoplasmic inclusions within cells. The 25-kDa C-terminal fragment is more prone to phosphorylation at S409/S410 than full-length TDP-43, but phosphorylation at these sites is not required for inclusion formation or toxicity. Although this fragment shows no biological activity, its exogenous expression neither inhibits the function nor causes the sequestration of full-length nuclear TDP-43, suggesting that the 25-kDa fragment can induce cell death through a toxic gain-of-function. Finally, by generating a conformation-dependent antibody that detects C-terminal fragments, we show that this toxic cleavage product is specific for pathologic inclusions in human TDP-43 proteinopathies.","2009-05-05","2021-10-26 20:20:27","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-26 20:20:27","7607-7612","","18","106","","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 19383787 PMCID: PMC2671323","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/ENKUU5V2/Zhang et al. - 2009 - Aberrant cleavage of TDP-43 enhances aggregation a.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671323/","::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent tardbp GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent  caspase-1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P29466; ::agent  tau PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636; ::agent mapt  GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we examined the biophysical properties of six ALS-linked TDP-43 mutants and found that one of the mutants, D169G, had higher thermal stability than wild-type TDP-43 and that it was cleaved by caspase 3 more efficiently, producing increased levels of the C-terminal 35 kD fragments (TDP-35) in vitro and in neuroblastoma cells. The crystal structure of the TDP-43 RRM1 domain containing the D169G mutation in complex with DNA along with molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the D169G mutation induces a local conformational change in a β turn and increases the hydrophobic interactions in the RRM1 core, thus enhancing the thermal stability of the RRM1 domain. Our results provide the first crystal structure of TDP-43 containing a disease-linked D169G mutation and a disease-related mechanism showing that D169G mutant is more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by caspase 3 into the pathogenic C-terminal 35-kD fragments due to its increased stability in the RRM1 domain.

Progranulin is proteolytically processed into granulins, but the role of granulins in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease is unknown. We used a Caenorhabditis elegans model of neuronal TDP-43 proteinopathy to specifically interrogate the contribution of granulins to the neurodegenerative process. Complete loss of the progranulin gene did not worsen TDP-43 toxicity, whereas progranulin heterozygosity did. Interestingly, expression of individual granulins alone had little effect on behavior. In contrast, when granulins were coexpressed with TDP-43, they exacerbated its toxicity in a variety of behaviors including motor coordination. These same granulins increased TDP-43 levels via a post-translational mechanism. We further found that in human neurodegenerative disease subjects, granulin fragments accumulated specifically in diseased regions of brain. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a toxic role for granulin fragments in a neurodegenerative disease model. These studies suggest that presence of cleaved granulins, rather than or in addition to loss of full-length progranulin, may contribute to disease in TDP-43 proteinopathies.","2015-06-24","2021-10-26 21:09:40","2021-12-08 14:50:17","2021-10-26 21:09:40","9315-9328","","25","35","","J.

Nuclear TDP-43 protein with key roles in RNA metabolism is also aggregated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting that ALS and FTLD constitute a broad disease continuum. However, the fact that mutations in GRN are associated with FTLD, while mutations in TDP-43 cause a preferential loss of motor neurons resulting in ALS-end of the disease spectrum, suggests involvement of both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. Studies on animal models and in vitro studies have been instrumental in understanding the link between GRN and TDP-43 and also their role in neurodegeneration. For instance, in mouse models, allelic deficiencies of Grn do not recapitulate human pathology of TDP-43 brain accumulations, but embryonic neurons derived from these mice do show abnormal TDP-43 accumulation after additional cellular challenges, suggesting that TDP-43 changes observed in GRN mutation carriers might also relate to stress. Recent results have shown that the dual action of GRN in growth modulation and inflammation could be due to its negative regulation of TNF-α signaling. In addition, GRN also interacts with sortilin and is endocytosed, thereby regulating its own levels and possibly also modulating the turnover of other proteins including that of TDP-43. Accumulating evidence suggests that TDP-43 abnormal cellular aggregation causes a possible gain of function, also suggested by recently constructed mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathy; however, it would be inconvincible that sequestration of physiological TDP-43 within cellular aggregates observed in patients would be innocuous for disease pathogenesis. This review discusses some of these data on the possible link between GRN and TDP-43 as well as mechanisms involved in TDP-43-led neurodegeneration. Continued multitiered efforts on genetic, cell biological, and animal modeling approaches would prove crucial in finding a cure for GRN-related diseases.","2011-08-24","2021-10-27 15:22:19","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-10-27 15:22:19","561","","3","45","","J Mol Neurosci","Progranulin and TDP-43","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/MA2J4EZI/Kumar-Singh - 2011 - Progranulin and TDP-43 Mechanistic Links and Futu.pdf","","::category genetics; ::category neuroinflammation; ::category progranulin pathology; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The clinical importance of PGRN became especially evident in 2006, when heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene, resulting in haploinsuffiency, were found to be one of the main causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is a clinically heterogenous disease that results in the progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Despite significant research, the exact function of PGRN and its mechanistic relationship to FTLD remain unclear. However, growing evidence suggests a role for PGRN in the lysosome – most striking being that homozygous GRN mutation leads to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease (LSD). Since this discovery, several links between PGRN and the lysosome have been established, including the existence of two independent lysosomal trafficking pathways, intralysosomal processing of PGRN into discrete functional peptides, and direct and indirect regulation of lysosomal hydrolases. Here we summarize cellular functions of PGRN, roles of PGRN in the nervous system and its link to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus dedicated to recent lysosome-related mechanistic developments.","2018-07","2021-10-27 16:51:33","2021-12-08 14:50:17","2021-10-27 16:51:33","1-17","","1","136","","Acta Neuropathol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 29744576 PMCID: PMC6117207","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/AIZV36DG/Paushter et al. - 2018 - The lysosomal function of progranulin, a guardian .pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6117207/","::category lysosomal clearance; ::category neuroinflammation; ::category progranulin pathology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autophagy encompasses pathways that target long-lived cytosolic proteins and damaged organelles. It involves a sequential set of events including double membrane formation, elongation, vesicle maturation and finally delivery of the targeted materials to the lysosome. Apoptotic cell death is best described through its morphology. It is characterized by cell rounding, membrane blebbing, cytoskeletal collapse, cytoplasmic condensation, and fragmentation, nuclear pyknosis, chromatin condensation/fragmentation, and formation of membrane-enveloped apoptotic bodies, that are rapidly phagocytosed by macrophages or neighboring cells. Neurodegenerative disorders are becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in the Western societies, with larger percentage of members living to an older age. They have to be seen not only as a health problem, but since they are care-intensive, they also carry a significant economic burden. Deregulation of autophagy plays a pivotal role in the etiology and/or progress of many of these diseases. Herein, we briefly review the latest findings that indicate the involvement of autophagy in neurodegenerative diseases. We provide a brief introduction to autophagy and apoptosis pathways focusing on the role of mitochondria and lysosomes. We then briefly highlight pathophysiology of common neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Then, we describe functions of autophagy and apoptosis in brain homeostasis, especially in the context of the aforementioned disorders. Finally, we discuss different ways that autophagy and apoptosis modulation may be employed for therapeutic intervention during the maintenance of neurodegenerative disorders.","2014-01-01","2021-10-27 18:33:17","2021-12-20 18:14:21","2021-10-27 18:33:16","24-49","","","112","","Progress in Neurobiology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/657ZCZPQ/Ghavami et al. - 2014 - Autophagy and apoptosis dysfunction in neurodegene.pdf","","::category apoptosis;

While mutations in the TARDBP gene that codes for the protein have been identified as causing disease in a small subset of patients, TDP-43 proteinopathy is present in the majority of cases regardless of mutation status. This raises key questions regarding the mechanisms by which TDP-43 proteinopathy arises and spreads throughout the central nervous system. Numerous studies have explored the role of a variety of cellular functions on the disease process, and nucleocytoplasmic transport, protein homeostasis, RNA interactions and cellular stress have all risen to the forefront as possible contributors to the initiation of TDP-43 pathogenesis. There is also a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that aggregation-prone TDP-43 can recruit physiological TDP-43, and be transmitted intercellularly, providing a mechanism whereby small-scale proteinopathy spreads from cell to cell, reflecting the spread of clinical symptoms observed in patients. This review will discuss the potential role of the aforementioned cellular functions in TDP-43 pathogenesis, and explore how aberrant pathology may spread, and result in a feed-forward cascade effect, leading to robust TDP-43 proteinopathy and disease.","2021-06-02","2021-11-01 17:59:24","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-01 17:59:24","6004","","11","22","","Int J Mol Sci","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 34199367 PMCID: PMC8199531","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/8D4222WN/Chen and Mitchell - 2021 - Mechanisms of TDP-43 Proteinopathy Onset and Propa.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199531/","::category autophagy; ::category lysosomal clearance; ::category nuclear transport; ::category rna processing; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the determinants of TDP-43 localization and the cellular insults that promote redistribution are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the putative Nuclear Export Signal (NES) is not required for nuclear egress of TDP-43. Moreover, when the TDP-43 domain which contains the putative NES is fused to a reporter protein, YFP, the presence of the NES is not sufficient to mediate nuclear exclusion of the fusion protein. We find that the previously studied “∆NES” mutant, in which conserved hydrophobic residues are mutated to alanines, disrupts both solubility and splicing function. We further show that nuclear export of TDP-43 is independent of the exportin XPO1. Finally, we provide evidence that nuclear egress of TDP-43 is size dependent; nuclear export of dTomato TDP-43 is significantly impaired compared to Flag TDP-43. Together, these results suggest nuclear export of TDP-43 is predominantly driven by passive diffusion.","2018-05-04","2021-11-01 21:13:52","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-01 21:13:52","7083","","1","8","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2018 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Diseases of the nervous system;Nuclear transport Subject_term_id: diseases-of-the-nervous-system;nuclear-transport","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/IKQM58LM/Pinarbasi et al. - 2018 - Active nuclear import and passive nuclear export a.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/BYHX5LTZ/s41598-018-25008-4.html","","::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent exportin-1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O14980; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed an experimental system for visualising the perturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport of neuronal TDP-43 at the single-cell level in vivo using zebrafish spinal cord. This approach enabled us to image TDP-43-expressing motor neurons before and after experimental initiation of cell death. We report the formation of mobile TDP-43 deposits within degenerating motor neurons, which are normally phagocytosed by microglia. However, when microglial cells were depleted, injury-induced motor neuron degeneration follows a characteristic process that includes TDP-43 redistribution into the cytoplasm, axon and extracellular space. This is the first demonstration of perturbed TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic transport in vivo, and suggests that impairment in microglial phagocytosis of dying neurons may contribute towards the formation of pathological TDP-43 presentations in ALS and FTLD.","2018","2021-11-02 00:43:54","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-02 00:43:54","445-459","","3","136","","Acta Neuropathol","Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of TDP-43 studied in real time","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 29943193 PMCID: PMC6096729","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/LJJKDQSE/Svahn et al. - 2018 - Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of TDP-43 studied in .pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6096729/","::category nuclear transport; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TDP-43 inclusions also characterize patients with GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 that causes the most common genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9ALS/FTD). Functional studies in cell and animal models have identified pathogenic mechanisms including repeat-induced RNA toxicity and accumulation of G4C2-derived dipeptide-repeat proteins. The role of TDP-43 dysfunction in C9ALS/FTD, however, remains elusive. We found G4C2-derived dipeptide-repeat protein but not G4C2-RNA accumulation caused TDP-43 proteinopathy that triggered onset and progression of disease in Drosophila models of C9ALS/FTD. Timing and extent of TDP-43 dysfunction was dependent on levels and identity of dipeptide-repeat proteins produced, with poly-GR causing early and poly-GA/poly-GP causing late onset of disease. Accumulating cytosolic, but not insoluble aggregated TDP-43 caused karyopherin-α2/4 (KPNA2/4) pathology, increased levels of dipeptide-repeat proteins and enhanced G4C2-related toxicity. Comparable KPNA4 pathology was observed in both sporadic frontotemporal dementia and C9ALS/FTD patient brains characterized by its nuclear depletion and cytosolic accumulation, irrespective of TDP-43 or dipeptide-repeat protein aggregates. These findings identify a vicious feedback cycle for dipeptide-repeat protein-mediated TDP-43 and subsequent KPNA pathology, which becomes self-sufficient of the initiating trigger and causes C9-related neurodegeneration.","2018-10-01","2021-11-02 17:50:51","2021-12-12 23:19:50","2021-11-02 17:50:51","2908-2924","","10","141","","Brain","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/THJLSJ2K/Solomon et al. - 2018 - A feedback loop between dipeptide-repeat protein, .pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/7Z2JB95U/5104292.html","","::category c9orf72 pathology; ::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::agent tardbp  GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent kpna2 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P52292; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent c9orf72  PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96LT7; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A given protein abundance can be obtained from infinitely many combinations of these rates. This raises the question of whether the natural rates for each gene result from historical accidents, or are there rules that give certain combinations a selective advantage? We address this question using high-throughput measurements in rapidly growing cells from diverse organisms to find that about half of the rate combinations do not exist: genes that combine high transcription with low translation are strongly depleted. This depletion is due to a trade-off between precision and economy: high transcription decreases stochastic fluctuations but increases transcription costs. Our theory quantitatively explains which rate combinations are missing, and predicts the curvature of the fitness function for each gene. It may guide the design of gene circuits with desired expression levels and noise., The same protein abundance can be achieved by many combinations of transcription, translation and degradation rates. Here, the authors find that genes combining high transcription with low translation rate are rare due to a trade-off between the cost of transcription and expression noise.","2019-01-08","2021-11-03 15:43:33","2021-12-14 15:56:22","2021-11-03 15:43:33","68","","","10","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30622246 PMCID: PMC6325141","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/NPWLHGNK/Hausser et al. - 2019 - Central dogma rates and the trade-off between prec.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325141/","::category reference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In healthy individuals, TDP-43 is primarily localized to the nucleus; it can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and is involved in several aspects of RNA processing including transcription, splicing, RNA stability, transport, localization, stress granule (SG) formation, and translation. Upon stress, TDP-43 aggregates in the cytoplasm and associates with several types of RNA and protein assemblies, resulting in nuclear depletion of TDP-43. Under conditions of prolonged stress, cytoplasmic TDP-43 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and becomes less mobile. Evidence exists to support a scenario in which insoluble TDP-43 complexes sequester RNA and/or proteins causing disturbances in both ribostasis and proteostasis, which in turn contribute to neurodegeneration. However, the relationship between RNA binding and TDP-43 toxicity remains unclear. Recent studies provide conflicting views on the role of RNA in TDP-43 toxicity, with some finding RNA as a toxic factor whereby RNA binding contributes to TDP-43 toxicity, while others find RNA to be a protective factor that inhibits TDP-43 aggregation. Here we review and discuss these recent reports, which ultimately highlight the importance of understanding the heterogeneity of TDP-43 assemblies and collectively point to solubilizing TDP-43 as a potential therapeutic strategy.","2020","2021-11-04 15:33:29","2021-12-08 15:40:02","2021-11-04 15:33:29","154","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/ACY6IJKJ/Loganathan et al. - 2020 - To Be or Not To Be…Toxic—Is RNA Association With T.pdf","","::category nuclear transport; ::category rna processing; ::category stress granules; ::category tdp-43 aggregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our data show that TDP-43 is a specific component of SGs and not of processing bodies, although we proved that TDP-43 is not necessary for SG formation, and its gene silencing does not impair cell survival during stress. The analysis of spinal cord tissue from ALS patients showed that SG markers are not entrapped in TDP-43 pathological inclusions. Although SGs were not evident in ALS brains, we speculate that an altered control of mRNA translation in stressful conditions may trigger motor neuron degeneration at early stages of the disease.","2009","2021-11-04 15:53:36","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-04 15:53:36","1051-1061","","4","111","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2009.06383.x","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/W3U58SWP/Colombrita et al. - 2009 - TDP-43 is recruited to stress granules in conditio.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/PR97AGNM/j.1471-4159.2009.06383.html","","::category biomarkers; ::category rna processing; ::category stress granules; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although TDP-43 resembles heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, its RNA targets and physiological protein partners remain unknown. Here we identify RNA targets of TDP-43 from cortical neurons by RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (RIP-seq). The canonical TDP-43 binding site (TG) is 55.1-fold enriched, and moreover, a variant with adenine in the middle, (TG)TA(TG) is highly abundant among reads in our TDP-43 RIP-seq library. TDP-43 RNA targets can be divided into three different groups: those primarily binding in introns, in exons, and across both introns and exons. TDP-43 RNA targets are particularly enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to synaptic function, RNA metabolism, and neuronal development. Furthermore, TDP-43 binds to a number of RNAs encoding for proteins implicated in neurodegeneration, including TDP-43 itself, FUS/TLS, progranulin, Tau, and ataxin 1 and -2. We also identify 25 proteins that co-purify with TDP-43 from rodent brain nuclear extracts. Prominent among them are nuclear proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing and RNA stability and transport. Also notable are two neuron-enriched proteins, methyl CpG-binding protein 2 and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2). A PTBP2 consensus RNA binding motif is enriched in the TDP-43 RIP-seq library, suggesting that PTBP2 may co-regulate TDP-43 RNA targets. This work thus reveals the protein and RNA components of the TDP-43-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes and provides a framework for understanding how dysregulation of TDP-43 in RNA metabolism contributes to neurodegeneration.","2011-01-14","2021-11-11 15:07:35","2021-12-08 14:50:51","2021-11-11 15:07:35","1204-1215","","2","286","","Journal of Biological Chemistry","","","","","","","","English","","","","","www.jbc.org","","Publisher: Elsevier PMID: 21051541","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/G4QI4PD6/fulltext.html; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/36DX5JCJ/Sephton et al. - 2011 - Identification of Neuronal RNA Targets of TDP-43-c.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21051541","::category fus pathology; ::category rna processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Furthermore, we show that aberrant phase transitions of cytoplasmic TDP-43 are neurotoxic and that treatment with oligonucleotides composed of TDP-43 target sequences prevent inclusions and rescue neurotoxicity.

Several cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-seq) analyses have indicated that TDP-43 in vivo can also specifically bind loosely conserved UG/GU-rich repeats interspersed by other nucleotides. These sequences are predominantly localized within long introns and in the 3′UTR of various genes. Most importantly, some of these sequences have been found to exist in the 3′UTR region of TDP-43 itself. In the TDP-43 3′UTR context, the presence of these UG-like sequences is essential for TDP-43 to autoregulate its own levels through a negative feedback loop. In this work, we have compared the binding of TDP-43 with these types of sequences as opposed to perfect UG-stretches. We show that the binding affinity to the UG-like sequences has a dissociation constant (K d ) of ∼110 nM compared with a K d of 8 nM for straight UGs, and have mapped the region of contact between protein and RNA. In addition, our results indicate that the local concentration of UG dinucleotides in the CLIP sequences is one of the major factors influencing the interaction of these RNA sequences with TDP-43.","2013-05-01","2021-11-11 16:02:29","2021-12-10 18:28:16","2021-11-11 16:02:29","5062-5074","","9","41","","Nucleic Acids Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/9WKQE62C/Bhardwaj et al. - 2013 - Characterizing TDP-43 interaction with its RNA tar.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/BWSPCSBD/2409404.html","","::category rna processing; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modified antisense oligonucleotides, continuously infused intraventricularly, have been demonstrated to distribute widely throughout the CNS of rodents and primates, including the regions affected in the major neurodegenerative diseases. Using this route of administration, we found that antisense oligonucleotides to superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), one of the most abundant brain proteins, reduced both SOD1 protein and mRNA levels throughout the brain and spinal cord. Treatment initiated near onset significantly slowed disease progression in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by a mutation in SOD1.

Complex interacting pathways are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), wherein multiple proteins tend to misfold in a manner that is “reactive,” but, subsequently, each proteinopathy may contribute strongly to the clinical symptoms. Tau proteinopathy exists in brains of individuals across a broad spectrum of primary underlying conditions—e.g., developmental, traumatic, and inflammatory/infectious diseases. TDP-43 proteinopathy is also expressed in a wide range of clinical disorders.  Although TDP-43 proteinopathy was first described in the central nervous system of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD/FTLD), TDP-43 proteinopathy is also present in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cognitively impaired persons in advanced age with hippocampal sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and other diseases. We list known Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies.  There is also evidence of cellular co-localization between Tau and TDP-43 misfolded proteins, suggesting common pathways or protein interactions facilitating misfolding in one protein by the other. Multiple pleiotropic gene variants can alter risk for Tau or TDP-43 pathologies, and certain gene variants (e.g., APOE ε4, Huntingtin triplet repeats) are associated with increases of both Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Studies of genetic risk factors have provided insights into multiple nodes of the pathologic cascades involved in Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Variants from a specific gene can be either a low-penetrant risk factor for a group of diseases, or alternatively, a different variant of the same gene may be a disease-driving allele that is associated with a relatively aggressive and early-onset version of a clinically and pathologically specific disease type. Overall, a complex but enlightening paradigm has emerged, wherein both Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies are linked to numerous overlapping upstream influences, and both are associated with multiple downstream pathologically- and clinically-defined deleterious effects.","2019-07","2021-11-12 20:03:28","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-12 20:03:28","993-1007","","7","99","","Lab Invest","Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies","","","","","","","en","2019 United States & Canadian Academy of Pathology","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 7 Primary_atype: Reviews Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Alzheimer's disease Subject_term_id: alzheimers-disease","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/BYIHABVI/Chornenkyy et al. - 2019 - Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies kindred pathologic.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/2PTATMRP/s41374-019-0196-y.html","","::category mapt/tau pathology; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we have examined whether the co-expression of human tauT175D with mutant human TDP-43 (TDP-43M337V) will act synergistically. Transgenic female Sprague-Dawley rats that inducibly express mutant human TDP-43M337V using the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) tetracycline response element (TRE) driver with activity modulating tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) were utilized in these studies. Adult rats were injected with GFP-tagged tau protein constructs in a rAAV9 vector through bilateral stereotaxic injection into the hippocampus. Injected tau constructs were: wild-type GFP-tagged 2N4R human tau (tauWT; n = 8), GFP-tagged tauT175D 2N4R human tau (tauT175D, pseudophosphorylated, toxic variant, n = 8), and GFP (control, n = 8). Six months post-injection, mutant TDP-43M337V expression was induced for 30 days. Behaviour testing identified motor deficits within 3 weeks after TDP-43 expression irrespective of tau expression, though social behaviour and sensorimotor gating remained unchanged. Increased tau pathology was observed in the hippocampus of both tauWT and tauT175D expressing rats and tauT175D pathology was increased in the presence of cholinergic neuronal expression of human TDP-43M337V.

Aggregates of post-translationally modified transactive response (TAR)-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are characteristic features in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recent studies have also reported TDP-43 aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). TDP-43 is an RNA/DNA binding protein (RBP) mainly present in the nucleus. In addition to several RBPs, TDP-43 has also been reported in stress granules in FTD and ALS pathologies. Despite knowledge of cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43, the cellular effects of TDP-43 aggregates and their cytotoxic mechanism(s) remain to be clarified. We hypothesize that TDP-43 forms oligomeric assemblies that associate with tau, another key protein involved in ALS and FTD. However, no prior studies have investigated the interactions between TDP-43 oligomers and tau. It is therefore important to thoroughly investigate the cross-seeding properties and cellular localization of both TDP-43 and tau oligomers in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we demonstrate the effect of tau on the cellular localization of TDP-43 in WT and P301L tau-inducible cell models (iHEK) and in WT HEK-293 cells treated exogenously with soluble human recombinant tau oligomers (Exo-rTauO). We observed cytoplasmic TDP-43 accumulation o in the presence of tau in these cell models. We also studied the occurrence of TDP-43 oligomers in AD, ALS, and FTD human brain tissue using novel antibodies generated against TDP-43 oligomers as well as generic TDP-43 antibodies. Finally, we examined the cross-seeding property of AD, ALS, and FTD brain-derived TDP-43 oligomers (BDT43Os) on tau aggregation using biochemical and biophysical assays.

An increasing number of genetic causes of ALS are being identified, but how these genetic defects lead to motor neuron degeneration and to which extent they affect common cellular pathways remains incompletely understood. To address these questions, we performed an interactomic analysis to identify binding partners of wild-type (WT) and ALS-associated mutant versions of ATXN2, C9orf72, FUS, OPTN, TDP-43 and UBQLN2 in neuronal cells. This analysis identified several known but also many novel binding partners of these proteins. Interactomes of WT and mutant ALS proteins were very similar except for OPTN and UBQLN2, in which mutations caused loss or gain of protein interactions. Several of the identified interactomes showed a high degree of overlap: shared binding partners of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43 had roles in RNA metabolism; OPTN- and UBQLN2-interacting proteins were related to protein degradation and protein transport, and C9orf72 interactors function in mitochondria. To confirm that this overlap is important for ALS pathogenesis, we studied fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), one of the common interactors of ATXN2, FUS and TDP-43, in more detail in in vitro and in vivo model systems for FUS ALS. FMRP localized to mutant FUS-containing aggregates in spinal motor neurons and bound endogenous FUS in a direct and RNA-sensitive manner. Furthermore, defects in synaptic FMRP mRNA target expression, neuromuscular junction integrity, and motor behavior caused by mutant FUS in zebrafish embryos, could be rescued by exogenous FMRP expression. Together, these results show that interactomics analysis can provide crucial insight into ALS disease mechanisms and they link FMRP to motor neuron dysfunction caused by FUS mutations.","2016-08","2021-11-15 16:58:12","2021-12-20 18:16:02","","175-196","","2","132","","Acta Neuropathol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27164932 PMCID: PMC4947123","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/ZVEYQHBU/Blokhuis et al. - 2016 - Comparative interactomics analysis of different AL.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27164932","::category fus pathology; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent tardbp GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent fmrp PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q06787; ::agent ubqln2 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UHD9; ::agent fus PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P35637; ::agent atxn2 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q99700; ::agent optn PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96CV9; ::category als; ::agent c9orf72 PROTEIN GENE https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q96LT7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The defect in acidification was rescued by reexpression of wild type (WT) UBQLN2 but not by any of the five different UBQLN2 ALS/FTD mutants tested. Proteomic analysis and immunoblot studies revealed P497S mutant mice and UBQLN2 knockout HeLa and NSC34 cells have reduced expression of ATP6v1g1, a critical subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) pump. Knockout of UBQLN2 expression in HeLa cells decreased turnover of ATP6v1g1, while overexpression of WT UBQLN2 increased biogenesis of ATP6v1g1 compared with P497S mutant UBQLN2 protein. In vitro interaction studies showed that ATP6v1g1 binds more strongly to WT UBQLN2 than to ALS/FTD mutant UBQLN2 proteins. Intriguingly, overexpression of ATP6v1g1 in UBQLN2 knockout HeLa cells increased autophagosome acidification, suggesting a therapeutic approach to overcome the acidification defect. Taken together, our findings suggest that UBQLN2 mutations drive pathogenesis through a dominant-negative loss-of-function mechanism in autophagy and that UBQLN2 functions as an important regulator of the expression and stability of ATP6v1g1. These findings may have important implications for devising therapies to treat UBQLN2-linked ALS/FTD.","2020-06-30","2021-11-15 17:58:54","2021-12-21 03:59:32","2021-11-15 17:58:54","15230-15241","","26","117","","PNAS","","","","","","","","en","© 2020 . https://www.pnas.org/site/aboutpnas/licenses.xhtmlPublished under the PNAS license.","","","","www.pnas.org","","Publisher: National Academy of Sciences Section: Biological Sciences PMID: 32513711","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/VGKJU6GI/Wu et al. - 2020 - ALSFTD mutations in UBQLN2 impede autophagy by re.pdf; ; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/PJ2M9EXA/15230.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513711","::category autophagy; ::process lysosomal protein degradation; ::agent atp6v1g1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O75348; ::agent ubqln2 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UHD9; ::agent mtor PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P42345; ::agent sqstm1 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13501; ::process mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy @ mtor < autophagy; ::category als; ::process autophagy; ::process binding of atp6v1g1 and ubqln2 @ atp6v1g1 @ ubqln2; ::process atp6v1g1 expression > autophagosome acidification + atp6v1g1; ::process chaperone-mediated folding of atp6v1g1 + atp6v1g1; ::process formation of ubqln2 inclusions @ ubqln2 > p62 co-localizes with ubqln2; ::process ubqln2 expression + ubqln2 > autophagosome formation; ::process autophagosome formation; ::process autophagosome acidification > autophagy; ::process inhibition of ubqln2 expression < mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy < atp6v1g1 expression < autophagosome formation < ubqln2 expression; ::process ubqln2 mutation < mtor-mediated inhibition of autophagy < autophagosome formation < atp6v1g1 expression < binding of atp6v1g1 and ubqln2 > formation of ubqln2 inclusions = ubqln2 expression; ::process p62 co-localizes with ubqln2 @ sqstm1 @ ubqln2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these two diseases, the majority of patients display the presence of aggregated forms of one of these proteins in their brains. The study of their functional properties currently represents a very promising target for developing the effective therapeutic options that are still lacking. This aim, however, must be preceded by an accurate evaluation of TDP-43 and FUS/TLS biological functions, both in physiological and disease conditions. Recent findings have uncovered several aspects of RNA metabolism that can be affected by misregulation of these two proteins. Progress has also been made in starting to understand how the aggregation of these proteins occurs and spreads from cell to cell. The aim of this review will be to provide a general overview of TDP-43 and FUS/TLS proteins and to highlight their physiological functions. At present, the emerging picture is that TDP-43 and FUS/TLS control several aspects of an mRNA's life, but they can also participate in DNA repair processes and in non-coding RNA metabolism. Although their regulatory activities are similar, they regulate mainly distinct RNA targets and show different pathogenetic mechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal lobar dementia diseases. The identification of key events in these processes represents today the best chance of finding targetable options for therapeutic approaches that might actually make a difference at the clinical level. The two major RNA Binding Proteins involved in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosisi and Frontotemporal Dementia are TDP-43 and FUST/TLS. Both proteins are involved in regulating all aspects of RNA and RNA life cycle within neurons, from transcription, processing, and transport/stability to the formation of cytoplasmic and nuclear stress granules. For this reason, the aberrant aggregation of these factors during disease can impair multiple RNA metabolic pathways and eventually lead to neuronal death/inactivation. The purpose of this review is to provide an up-to-date perspective on what we know about this issue at the molecular level.

Some patients present with motor symptoms including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Genetic research over the past two decades in FTLD families led to the identification of three common FTLD genes (microtubule-associated protein tau, progranulin, and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72) and a small number of rare FTLD genes, explaining the disease in almost all autosomal dominant FTLD families but only a minority of apparently sporadic patients or patients in whom the family history is less clear. Identification of additional FTLD (risk) genes is therefore highly anticipated, especially with the emerging use of next-generation sequencing. Common variants in the transmembrane protein 106 B were identified as a genetic risk factor of FTLD and disease modifier in patients with known mutations. This review summarizes for each FTLD gene what we know about the type and frequency of mutations, their associated clinical and pathological features, and potential disease mechanisms. We also provide an overview of emerging disease pathways encompassing multiple FTLD genes. We further discuss how FTLD specific issues, such as disease heterogeneity, the presence of an unclear family history and the possible role of an oligogenic basis of FTLD, can pose challenges for future FTLD gene identification and risk assessment of specific variants. Finally, we highlight emerging clinical, genetic, and translational research opportunities that lie ahead. Genetic research led to the identification of three common FTLD genes with rare variants (MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72) and a small number of rare genes. Efforts are now ongoing, which aimed at the identification of rare variants with high risk and/or low frequency variants with intermediate effect. Common risk variants have also been identified, such as TMEM106B. This review discusses the current knowledge on FTLD genes and the emerging disease pathways encompassing multiple FTLD genes.

Moreover, genetic studies identified mutations in the MAPT gene encoding tau in familial cases of the disease. In this review, we cover a range of aspects of tau function, both in the healthy and diseased brain, discussing several in vitro and in vivo models. Tau structure and function in the healthy brain is presented, accentuating its distinct compartmentalization in neurons and its role in microtubule stabilization and axonal transport. Furthermore, tau-driven pathology is discussed, introducing current concepts and the underlying experimental evidence. Different aspects of pathological tau phosphorylation, the protein's genomic and domain organization as well as its spreading in disease, together with MAPT-associated mutations and their respective models are presented. Dysfunction related to other post-transcriptional modifications and their effect on normal neuronal functions such as cell cycle, epigenetics and synapse dynamics are also discussed, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observations made in FTLD-tau cases, with the possibility for therapeutic intervention. In this review, we cover aspects of tau function, both in the healthy and diseased brain, referring to different in vitro and in vivo models. In healthy neurons, tau is compartmentalized, with higher concentrations found in the distal part of the axon. Cargo molecules are sensitive to this gradient. A disturbed tau distribution, as found in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau), has severe consequences for cellular physiology: tau accumulates in the neuronal soma and dendrites, leading among others to microtubule depolymerization and impaired axonal transport. Tau forms insoluble aggregates that sequester additional molecules stalling cellular physiology. Neuronal communication is gradually lost as toxic tau accumulates in dendritic spines with subsequent degeneration of synapses and synaptic loss. Thus, by providing a mechanistic explanation for the observations made in FTLD-tau cases, arises a possibility for therapeutic interventions.

There is increasing evidence that defective or mislocalized RBPs – and consequently altered mRNA processing – lead to neuronal dysfunction and cause neurodegeneration, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Cytosolic RBP aggregates containing TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) or fused in sarcoma (FUS) are a common hallmark of both disorders. There is mounting evidence that translationally silent mRNP granules, such as stress granules or transport granules, play an important role in the formation of these RBP aggregates. These granules are thought to be ‘catalytic convertors’ of RBP aggregation by providing a high local concentration of RBPs. As recently shown in vitro, RBPs that contain a so-called low-complexity domain start to ‘solidify’ and eventually aggregate at high protein concentrations. The same may happen in mRNP granules in vivo, leading to ‘solidified’ granules that lose their dynamic properties and ability to fulfill their physiological functions. This may result in a disturbed stress response, altered mRNA transport and local translation, and formation of pathological TDP-43 or FUS aggregates, all of which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Here, we discuss the general functional properties of these mRNP granules, how their dynamics may be disrupted in frontotemporal lobar degeneration/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, for example by loss or gain of function of TDP-43 and FUS, and how this may contribute to the development of RBP aggregates and neurotoxicity. In this review, we discuss how dynamic mRNP granules, such as stress granules or neuronal transport granules, may be converted into pathological aggregates containing misfolded RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), such as TDP-43 and FUS. Abnormal interactions between low-complexity domains in RBPs may cause dynamic mRNP granules to solidify and become dysfunctional. This may result in a disturbed stress response, altered mRNA transport and local translation, as well as RBP aggregation, all of which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

Yet, despite the vast amount of work aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of this repeat in disease, the exact pathomechanisms are still unclear. A reduction in the expression of the C9orf72 gene is observed in patients, but a gain-of-function model is now preferred. The hexanucleotide repeat expansion forms RNA foci in the central nervous system (CNS) of repeat-positive FTD and ALS patients, and these foci are believed to sequester RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and impair their function in RNA processing. At the same time, the repeat undergoes repeat-associated non-ATG translation to produce dipeptide repeat proteins that also form inclusions in the patient CNS. Studies from cells and flies suggest that these proteins may also be an important factor in the disease. Finally, the hexanucleotide repeat also induces the mislocalization and aggregation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) through an as yet unknown mechanism. This review covers the different potential pathogenic factors that have been put forth for C9orf72-repeat-associated FTD and ALS (C9-FTD/ALS), while highlighting some remaining questions. A repeat expansion in C9orf72 is a common cause of both frontal temporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although there is a decrease in C9orf72 expression in patients, this repeat is believed to induce disease primarily through an unknown gain-of-function mechanism involving the RNA, repeat-associated non-AUG translation, or both.

Characterized by severe atrophy of the frontal and temporal brain lobes, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) shows extreme heterogeneity in clinical presentation, genetic causes, and pathological findings. Like most neurodegenerative diseases, the initial symptoms of FTD are subtle, but increase in severity over time, as the disease progresses. Clinical progression is paralleled by exacerbation of pathological findings and the involvement of broader brain regions, which currently lack mechanistic explanation. Yet, a flurry of studies indicate that protein aggregates accumulating in neurodegenerative diseases can act as propagating entities, amplifying their pathogenic conformation, in a way similar to infectious prions. In this prion-centric view, FTD can be divided into three subtypes, TDP-43 or FUS proteinopathy and tauopathy. Here, we review the current evidence that FTD-linked pathology propagates in a prion-like manner and discuss the implications of these findings for disease progression and heterogeneity. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease causing severe personality dysfunctions, characterized by profound heterogeneity. Accumulation of tau, TDP-43 or FUS cytoplasmic aggregates characterize molecularly distinct and non-overlapping FTD subtypes.

It includes the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), the semantic and non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (svPPA and nfvPPA), FTD with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome. The diagnosis of the FTLD spectrum of diseases is based on clinical symptoms which hampers the differentiation of the diseases among each other and with other disorders that show a similar clinical appearance resulting in a high rate of misdiagnoses. This highlights the need for objective and selective measures in the diagnostic criteria and there is extensive research on neurochemical biomarkers in FTLD as one option to address this unmet clinical need. Here, we review the advances in CSF biomarker research in FTLD in the last 2 years with regard to the validation of previously suggested and identification of new biomarker candidates for the differential diagnosis of FTLD.

Whilst initial neuroimaging studies highlighted the presence of frontal and temporal lobe atrophy or hypometabolism as the unifying feature in patients with FTD, more detailed studies have revealed diverse patterns across individuals, with variable frontal or temporal predominance, differing degrees of asymmetry, and the involvement of other cortical areas including the insula and cingulate, as well as subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia and thalamus. Recent advances in novel imaging modalities including diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and molecular positron emission tomography imaging allow the possibility of investigating alterations in structural and functional connectivity and the visualisation of pathological protein deposition. This review will cover the major imaging modalities currently used in research and clinical practice, focusing on the key insights they have provided into FTD, including the onset and evolution of pathological changes and also importantly their utility as biomarkers for disease detection and staging, differential diagnosis and measurement of disease progression. Validating neuroimaging biomarkers that are able to accomplish these tasks will be crucial for the ultimate goal of powering upcoming clinical trials by correctly stratifying patient enrolment and providing sensitive markers for evaluating the effects and efficacy of disease-modifying therapies.

The accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates in the central nervous system is a common feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). Accumulating evidence suggests that prion-like spreading of aberrant protein aggregates composed of tau, amyloid-β, and α-synuclein is involved in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD. Similar to those of prion-like proteins, pathological aggregates of TDP-43 can be transferred from cell-to-cell in a seed-dependent and self-templating manner. Here, we review clinical and experimental studies supporting the prion-like spreading of misfolded TDP-43 and discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the propagation of these pathological aggregated proteins. The idea that misfolded TDP-43 spreads in a prion-like manner between cells may guide novel therapeutic strategies for TDP-43-associated neurodegenerative diseases., Further research is needed to determine how an aggregate-forming protein common to several neurodegenerative disorders propagates throughout the brain. Many neurodegenerative conditions involve aggregates created by ‘prion-like’ proteins, misfolded proteins that can confer their abnormal structure on neighboring healthy proteins, resulting in aggregates which spread rather like an infection. Hyung-Jun Kim at the Korea Brain Research Institute in Daegu, South Korea, and co-workers reviewed current understanding of the transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), an aggregate-forming protein implicated in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. Growing evidence suggests that TDP-43 may spread in a prion-like fashion. TDP-43 is implicated in the onset of Alzheimer’s, and the spread of misfolded TDP-43 aggregates is closely tied to disease severity. More research is needed into how TDP-43 propagates in different tissues and central nervous system cells.","2020-10-13","2021-11-15 19:56:02","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-15 19:56:02","1652-1662","","10","52","","Exp Mol Med","The role of TDP-43 propagation in neurodegenerative diseases","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 33051572 PMCID: PMC8080625","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/JAQY68YS/Jo et al. - 2020 - The role of TDP-43 propagation in neurodegenerativ.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8080625/","::category clinical; ::category exosomal clearance; ::category genetics; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we demonstrate how diverse environmental stressors linked to stress granule formation, as well as mutations in genes encoding RNA processing proteins and protein degradation adaptors, initiate ALS pathogenesis via TDP-43. We review the progressive development of TDP-43 proteinopathy from cytoplasmic mislocalization and misfolding through to macroaggregation and the addition of phosphate and ubiquitin moieties. Drawing from cellular and animal studies, we explore the feasibility of therapeutics that act at each point in pathogenesis, from mitigating genetic risk using antisense oligonucleotides to modulating TDP-43 proteinopathy itself using small molecule activators of autophagy, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, or the chaperone network.

Mutations in the progranulin (GRN) gene account for a significant fraction of familial FTLD, and in the vast majority of cases, these mutations lead to reduced expression of progranulin via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Progranulin is a secreted glycoprotein that regulates a diverse range of cellular functions including cell proliferation, cell migration, and inflammation. Recent fundamental discoveries about progranulin biology, including the findings that sortilin and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) are high affinity progranulin receptors, are beginning to shed light on the mechanism(s) by which progranulin deficiency causes FTLD.

Mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) have recently been identified as a major cause of FTLD with ubiquitin positive inclusions (FTLD-U). Because over 70 disease-linked GRN mutations cause abnormal deficiencies in the production of PGRN, a protein that plays a crucial role in embryogenesis, cell growth and survival, as well as wound repair and inflammation, researchers now aim to design therapies that would increase PGRN levels in affected individuals, thereby alleviating the symptoms associated with disease. Several compounds and genetic factors, as well as PGRN receptors, have recently been identified because of their ability to regulate PGRN levels. Strict quality control measures are needed given that extreme PGRN levels at either end of the spectrum – too low or too high – can lead to neurodegeneration or cancer, respectively.

Mechanisms controlling progranulin levels are largely unknown. To better understand progranulin regulation, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen using an ELISA-based platform to discover genes that regulate progranulin levels in neurons. We identified 830 genes that raise or lower progranulin levels by at least 1.5-fold in Neuro2a cells. When inhibited by siRNA or some by submicromolar concentrations of small-molecule inhibitors, 33 genes of the druggable genome increased progranulin levels in mouse primary cortical neurons; several of these also raised progranulin levels in FTLD model mouse neurons. “Hit” genes regulated progranulin by transcriptional or posttranscriptional mechanisms. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of hit genes from the autophagy–lysosome pathway (ALP), suggesting a key role for this pathway in regulating progranulin levels. Progranulin itself regulates lysosome function. We found progranulin deficiency in neurons increased autophagy and caused abnormally enlarged lysosomes and boosting progranulin levels restored autophagy and lysosome size to control levels. Our data link the ALP to neuronal progranulin: progranulin levels are regulated by autophagy and, in turn, progranulin regulates the ALP. Restoring progranulin levels by targeting genetic modifiers reversed FTLD functional deficits, opening up potential opportunities for future therapeutics development. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Progranulin regulates neuron and immune functions and is implicated in aging. Loss of one functional allele causes haploinsufficiency and leads to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), the second leading cause of dementia. Progranulin gene polymorphisms are linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and complete loss of function causes neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Despite the critical role of progranulin levels in neurodegenerative disease risk, almost nothing is known about their regulation. We performed an unbiased screen and identified specific pathways controlling progranulin levels in neurons. Modulation of these pathways restored levels in progranulin-deficient neurons and reversed FTLD phenotypes. We provide a new comprehensive understanding of the genetic regulation of progranulin levels and identify potential targets to treat FTLD and other neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.","2019-04-24","2021-11-16 19:35:30","2021-12-08 14:49:57","2021-11-16 19:35:30","3332-3344","","17","39","","J.

What once was viewed as a simple acidic organelle in charge of macromolecular digestion has emerged as a dynamic organelle capable of integrating cellular signals and producing signal outputs. In this review, we focus on the concept that the lysosome surface serves as a platform to assemble major signaling hubs like mTORC1, AMPK, GSK3 and the inflammasome. These molecular assemblies integrate and facilitate cross-talk between signals such as amino acid and energy levels, membrane damage and infection, and ultimately enable responses such as autophagy, cell growth, membrane repair and microbe clearance. In particular, we review how molecular machinery like the vacuolar-ATPase proton pump, sestrins, the GATOR complexes, and the Ragulator, modulate mTORC1, AMPK, GSK3 and inflammation. We then elaborate how these signals control autophagy initiation and resolution, TFEB-mediated lysosome adaptation, lysosome remodeling, antigen presentation, inflammation, membrane damage repair and clearance. Overall, by being at the cross-roads for several membrane pathways, lysosomes have emerged as the ideal surveillance compartment to sense, integrate and elicit cellular behavior and adaptation in response to changing environmental and cellular conditions.","2019-06-20","2021-11-16 19:40:46","2021-12-08 14:48:48","2021-11-16 19:40:46","113","","","7","","Front Cell Dev Biol","The Lysosome Signaling Platform","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 31281815 PMCID: PMC6595708","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/8QWYEGS7/Inpanathan and Botelho - 2019 - The Lysosome Signaling Platform Adapting With the.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6595708/","::category autophagy; ::category lysosomal clearance; ::category neuroinflammation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TDP-43’s involvement in nuclear factor-kappaB pathways has been reported in both neurons and microglial cells. The NF-κB pathway targets hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in inflammation, immunity and cancer. p50/p65 (p50/RelA) heterodimers, as the major Rel complex in the NF-κB family, are induced by diverse external physiological stimuli and modulate transcriptional activity in almost all cell types. Both p65 and TDP-43 translocation occur through the classic nuclear transportation system. In this study, we report that TDP-43 overexpression prevents TNF-α induced p65 nuclear translocation in a dose dependent manner, and that this further inhibits p65 transactivation activity. The inhibition by TDP-43 does not occur through preventing IκB degradation but probably by competing for the nuclear transporter-importin α3 (KPNA4). This competition is dependent on the presence of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in TDP-43. Silencing TDP-43 using a specific siRNA also increased p65 nuclear localization upon TNF-α stimulation, suggesting that endogenous TDP-43 may be a default suppressor of the NF-κB pathway. Our results indicate that TDP-43 may play an important role in regulating the levels of NF-κB activity by controlling the nuclear translocation of p65.","2015-11-16","2021-11-16 19:55:56","2021-12-08 14:53:00","2021-11-16 19:55:56","e0142296","","11","10","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/LS5STRIU/Zhu et al. - 2015 - TDP-43 Inhibits NF-κB Activity by Blocking p65 Nuc.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/DBSE5A2P/article.html","","::category neuroinflammation; ::category tdp-43 aggregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aged, homozygous GrnR493X mice (GrnR493X/R493X) have been shown to phenotypically replicate several neuropathological hallmarks previously demonstrated in Grn null mice. We conducted a comprehensive neuropathological and behavioral assessment of 18 month old GrnR493X/R493X mice, observing a striking lysosomal dysfunction and thalamic neurodegeneration not previously described in this model, as well as a male-specific increase in generalized anxiety. These findings provide additional phenotypic markers of pathogenesis in aged GrnR493X/R493X mice that will contribute to better defining mechanisms underlying FTD-GRN, and offer relevant outcome measures for preclinical efficacy testing of novel therapeutics that target nonsense mutations leading to this devastating disease.","2021-04-01","2021-11-16 22:05:28","2021-12-08 14:53:00","2021-11-16 22:05:28","57","","1","9","","Acta Neuropathologica Communications","","","","","","","","","","","","","BioMed Central","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/7KUTA96I/Frew and Nygaard - 2021 - Neuropathological and behavioral characterization .pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/SFFLQ9L3/s40478-021-01158-x.html","","::category clinical; ::category lysosomal clearance; ::category neuroinflammation; ::category nuclear transport; ::category progranulin pathology; ::category tdp-43 aggregation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study identified a polymorphism in the Stathmin-2 gene and investigated its association with sporadic ALS (sALS) disease risk, age-of onset and survival duration.MethodsThe candidate CA repeat was systematically analyzed using PCR, Sanger sequencing and high throughput capillary separation for genotyping. Stathmin-2 expression was investigated using RT-PCR in patient olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells and RNA sequencing in laser-captured spinal motor neurons.ResultsIn a case-control analysis of a combined North American sALS cohort (n = 321) and population control group (n = 332), long/long CA genotypes were significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.042), and most strongly when one allele was a 24 CA repeat (p = 0.0023). In addition, longer CA allele length was associated with earlier age-of-onset (p = 0.039), and shorter survival duration in bulbar-onset cases (p = 0.006). In an Australian longitudinal sALS cohort (n = 67), ALS functional rating scale scores were significantly lower in carriers of the long/long genotype (p = 0.034). Stathmin-2 mRNA expression was reduced in sporadic patient ONS cells. Additionally, sALS patients and controls exhibited variable expression of Stathmin-2 mRNA according to CA genotype in laser-captured spinal motor neurons.ConclusionsWe report a novel non-coding CA repeat in Stathmin-2 which is associated with sALS disease risk and has disease modifying effects. The potential value of this variant as a disease marker and tool for cohort enrichment in clinical trials warrants further investigation.","2021","2021-11-23 16:12:45","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-23 16:12:45","127","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/NNZEAINJ/Theunissen et al. - 2021 - Novel STMN2 Variant Linked to Amyotrophic Lateral .pdf","","::category biomarkers; ::category clinical; ::category genetics; ::category rna processing; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we identify that TDP-43 regulates expression of the neuronal growth-associated factor stathmin-2. Lowered TDP-43 levels, which reduce its binding to sites within the first intron of stathmin-2 pre-messenger RNA, uncover a cryptic polyadenylation site whose utilization produces a truncated, non-functional mRNA. Reduced stathmin-2 expression is found in neurons trans-differentiated from patient fibroblasts expressing an ALS-causing TDP-43 mutation, in motor cortex and spinal motor neurons from patients with sporadic ALS and familial ALS with GGGGCC repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons depleted of TDP-43. Remarkably, while reduction in TDP-43 is shown to inhibit axonal regeneration of iPSC-derived motor neurons, rescue of stathmin-2 expression restores axonal regenerative capacity. Thus, premature polyadenylation-mediated reduction in stathmin-2 is a hallmark of ALS-FTD that functionally links reduced nuclear TDP-43 function to enhanced neuronal vulnerability.","2019-02","2021-11-23 16:13:59","2021-12-12 23:20:08","","180-190","","2","22","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30643298 PMCID: PMC6348009","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/3Q8BQSQP/Melamed et al. - 2019 - Premature polyadenylation-mediated loss of stathmi.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643298","::category biomarkers; ::category clinical; ::category neuroinflammation; ::category rna processing; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inhibiting the nuclear export of CHMP7 triggered Nup reduction and TDP-43 dysfunction and pathology in human neurons. Knockdown of CHMP7 alleviated disease-associated Nup alterations, deficits in Ran GTPase localization, defects in TDP-43-associated mRNA expression, and downstream glutamate-induced neuronal death.

Most mRNA molecules degrade only after their tail lengths fall below 25 nt. Decay rate constants of short-tailed mRNAs vary broadly (1000-fold) and are larger for short-tailed mRNAs that have previously undergone more rapid deadenylation.

Recent studies implicate cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) as hubs that may facilitate TDP-43 aggregation. Here, using cellular fractionation, biochemical analyses, and histological assays, we show that TDP-43 targeted to the cytoplasm has multiple fates. Whereas a TDP-43 subpopulation is indeed recruited to SGs, mature aggregated TDP-43, produced with aggregate-prone TDP-43 variants or exposure to oxidative stress, generates distinct TDP-43 inclusions that are surprisingly devoid of SGs. Consistent with this observation, we found that SG components are predominantly excluded from TDP-43 pathology in motor neurons from individuals with ALS. We generated de novo SGs by expressing the fragile X protein (FMRP) and found that rather than directly engaging TDP-43 aggregates, SGs can sequester the proteostasis factor histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and thereby impede TDP-43 clearance from cells. These findings indicate that SGs form distinct cytoplasmic structures that can indirectly enhance TDP-43 aggregation. Therapeutic approaches that inhibit SG formation may therefore be effective at suppressing TDP-43–mediated toxicity in patients with ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies.","2019-03-08","2021-11-24 20:23:56","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-24 20:23:56","3696-3706","","10","294","","J Biol Chem","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 30630951 PMCID: PMC6416430","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/8SJEFSQV/Chen and Cohen - 2019 - Aggregation of the nucleic acid–binding protein TD.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6416430/","::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::agent tdp-43 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q13148; ::agent fmrp PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q06787; ::agent hdac6 PROTEIN https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UBN7; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The mobile fraction of HSP70-R in the cytoplasmic IBs associated with G-TDP-25 increased relative to that of G-TDP-25, suggesting that HSP70 strongly bound to G-TDP-25 in the IBs, whereas a portion remained dissociated from the IBs. Importantly, the proportion of G-TDP-25 IBs was significantly decreased by HSP70-R overexpression; however, G-TDP-25 levels in the insoluble fraction remained unchanged by HSP70-R overexpression, suggesting that G-TDP-25 formed aggregated species that cannot be dissolved, even in the presence of strong detergents.

We observed that endogenous TDP-43 undergoes reversible aggregation in the nucleus after the heat shock and that this behavior is mediated by the C-terminal prion domain. Substitution of the prion domain from TIA-1 or an authentic yeast prion domain from RNQ1 into TDP-43 can completely recapitulate heat shock-induced aggregation. TDP-43 is constitutively bound to members of the Hsp40/Hsp70 family, and we found that heat shock-induced TDP-43 aggregation is mediated by the availability of these chaperones interacting with the inherently disordered C-terminal prion domain. Finally, we observed that the aggregation of TDP-43 during heat shock led to decreased binding to hnRNPA1, and a change in TDP-43 RNA-binding partners suggesting that TDP-43 aggregation alters its function in response to misfolded protein stress. These findings indicate that TDP-43 shares properties with physiologic prions from yeast, in that self-aggregation is mediated by a Q/N-rich disordered domain, is modulated by chaperone proteins and leads to altered function of the protein. Furthermore, they indicate that TDP-43 aggregation is regulated by chaperone availability, explaining the recurrent observation of TDP-43 aggregates in degenerative diseases of both the brain and muscle where protein homeostasis is disrupted.","2014-01-01","2021-11-24 20:44:45","2021-12-12 23:20:08","","157-170","","1","23","","Hum Mol Genet","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23962724 PMCID: PMC3857952","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/TUV88JPD/Udan-Johns et al. - 2014 - Prion-like nuclear aggregation of TDP-43 during he.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23962724","::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TDP-43 pathology may also be present as a comorbidity in approximately 20–50% of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease cases. In a mouse model of MND, full-length TDP-43 increases association with the mitochondria and blocking the TDP-43/mitochondria interaction ameliorates motor dysfunction. Utilizing a proteomics screen, several mitochondrial TDP-43-interacting partners were identified, including voltage-gated anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a crucial mitophagy receptor. Overexpression of TDP-43 led to an increase in PHB2 whereas TDP-43 knockdown reduced PHB2 expression in cells treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an inducer of mitophagy. These results suggest that TDP-43 expression contributes to metabolism and mitochondrial function however we show no change in bioenergetics when TDP-43 is overexpressed and knocked down in HEK293T cells. Furthermore, the fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2) interacts in complex with TDP-43 and selective expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex induced an age-dependent change in Mfn2 expression. Mitochondria morphology is altered in 9-month-old mice selectively expressing TDP-43 in an APP/PS1 background compared with APP/PS1 littermates. We further confirmed TDP-43 localization to the mitochondria using immunogold labeled TDP-43 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and mitochondrial isolation methods There was no increase in full-length TDP-43 localized to the mitochondria in APP/PS1 mice compared to wild-type (littermates); however, using C- and N-terminal-specific TDP-43 antibodies, the N-terminal (27 kDa, N27) and C-terminal (30 kDa, C30) fragments of TDP-43 are greatly enriched in mitochondrial fractions. In addition, when the mitochondrial peptidase (PMPCA) is overexpressed there is an increase in the N-terminal fragment (N27).

Some intrinsically disordered proteins mediate membraneless organelle formation through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS facilitates many biological functions such as regulating RNA stability and ribonucleoprotein assembly, and disruption of LLPS pathways has been implicated in several diseases. Proteins exhibiting LLPS typically have low sequence complexity and specific repeat motifs. These motifs promote multivalent connections with other molecules and the formation of higher-order oligomers, and their removal usually prevents LLPS. The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a protein involved in motor neuron disease and dementia lacks a dominant LLPS motif, however, and how this domain forms condensates is unclear. Using extensive mutagenesis of TDP-43, we demonstrate here that three tryptophan residues and, to a lesser extent, four other aromatic residues are most important for TDP-43 to undergo LLPS. Our results also suggested that only a few residues may be required for TDP-43 LLPS because the α-helical segment (spanning ∼20 residues) in the middle part of the C-terminal domain tends to self-assemble, reducing the number of motifs required for forming a multivalent connection. Our results indicating that a self-associating α-helical element with a few key residues regulates condensate formation highlight a different type of LLPS involving intrinsically disordered regions. The C-terminal domain of TDP-43 contains ∼50 disease-related mutations, with no clear physicochemical link between them.

The aim of this study was to investigate how phase separation affects self-aggregation and aggregation seeded by pre-formed aggregates of either the low-complexity domain (LCD) or its short aggregation-promoting regions (APRs). By systematically varying the physicochemical conditions, we observed that liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) promotes spontaneous aggregation. However, we noticed less efficient seeded aggregation in phase separating conditions. By analyzing a broad range of conditions using the Hofmeister series of buffers, we confirmed that stabilizing hydrophobic interactions prevail over destabilizing electrostatic forces. RNA affected the cooperativity between LLPS and aggregation in a “reentrant” fashion, having the strongest positive effect at intermediate concentrations. Altogether, we conclude that conditions which favor LLPS enhance the subsequent aggregation of the TDP-43 LCD with complex dependence, but also negatively affect seeding kinetics.","2021-04","2021-11-24 20:56:27","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-11-24 20:56:27","548","","4","11","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/JQ9IM43G/Pakravan et al. - 2021 - Liquid–Liquid Phase Separation Enhances TDP-43 LCD.pdf; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/S23VYV9A/548.html","","::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The etiology of a major subset of ALS involves toxicity of the TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43). A second RNA/DNA binding protein, fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) has been subsequently associated with about 1% of ALS patients. While mutations in TDP-43 and FUS have been linked to ALS, the key contributing molecular mechanism(s) leading to cell death are still unclear. One unique feature of TDP-43 and FUS pathogenesis in ALS is their nuclear clearance and simultaneous cytoplasmic aggregation in affected motor neurons. Since the discoveries in the last decade implicating TDP-43 and FUS toxicity in ALS, a majority of studies have focused on their cytoplasmic aggregation and disruption of their RNA-binding functions. However, TDP-43 and FUS also bind to DNA, although the significance of their DNA binding in disease-affected neurons has been less investigated. A recent observation of accumulated genomic damage in TDP-43 and FUS-linked ALS and association of FUS with neuronal DNA damage repair pathways indicate a possible role of deregulated DNA binding function of TDP-43 and FUS in ALS. In this review, we discuss the different ALS disease subtypes, crosstalk of etiopathologies in disease progression, available animal models and their limitations, and recent advances in understanding the specific involvement of RNA/DNA binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, in motor neuron diseases.","2016-11","2021-11-24 21:04:32","2021-12-12 23:20:08","","78-97","","","145-146","","Prog Neurobiol","TDP-43/FUS in motor neuron disease","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27693252 PMCID: PMC5101148","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/7QKTIGBC/Guerrero et al. - 2016 - TDP-43FUS in motor neuron disease Complexity and.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27693252","::category fus pathology; ::category rna processing; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We previously demonstrated that ALS-associated mutant TDP43 accumulates within the cytoplasm, and that TDP43 mislocalization predicts neurodegeneration. Here, we sought to prevent neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD models using selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compounds that target exportin-1 (XPO1). SINE compounds modestly extend cellular survival in neuronal ALS/FTD models and mitigate motor symptoms in an in vivo rat ALS model. At high doses, SINE compounds block nuclear egress of an XPO1 cargo reporter, but not at lower concentrations that were associated with neuroprotection. Neither SINE compounds nor leptomycin B, a separate XPO1 inhibitor, enhanced nuclear TDP43 levels, while depletion of XPO1 or other exportins had little effect on TDP43 localization, suggesting that no single exporter is necessary for TDP43 export. Supporting this hypothesis, we find overexpression of XPO1, XPO7 and NXF1 are each sufficient to promote nuclear TDP43 egress. Taken together, our results indicate that redundant pathways regulate TDP43 nuclear export, and that therapeutic prevention of cytoplasmic TDP43 accumulation in ALS/FTD may be enhanced by targeting several overlapping mechanisms.","2018-03-15","2021-12-01 19:40:37","2021-12-12 23:20:08","","4606","","1","8","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29545601 PMCID: PMC5854632","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/CLW3EL26/Archbold et al. - 2018 - TDP43 nuclear export and neurodegeneration in mode.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29545601","::category nuclear transport; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TDP-43 is an essential nuclear protein that readily aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, cells must strictly maintain an appropriate amount of nuclear TDP-43. In one relevant maintenance mechanism, TDP-43 binds to its pre-mRNA and promotes alternative splicing, resulting in mRNA degradation via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The level of nuclear TDP-43 is tightly regulated by these mechanisms, which control the amount of mRNA that may be translated. Based on the results of previous experiments, we developed an in silico model that mimics the intracellular dynamics of TDP-43 and examined TDP-43 metabolism under various conditions. We discovered an inherent trade-off in this mechanism between transcriptional redundancy, which maintains the robustness of TDP-43 metabolism, and vulnerability to specific interfering factors. These factors include an increased tendency of TDP-43 to aggregate, impaired nuclear-cytoplasmic TDP-43 transport, and a decreased efficiency of degrading abnormal proteins, all of which are functional abnormalities related to the gene that causes familial ALS/FTD. When these conditions continue at a certain intensity, the vulnerability of the autoregulatory machinery becomes apparent over time, and transcriptional redundancy enters a vicious cycle that ultimately results in TDP-43 pathology. The results obtained using this in silico model reveal the difference in TDP-43 metabolism between normal and disease states. Furthermore, using this model, we simulated the effect of a decrease in TDP-43 transcription and found that this decrease improved TDP-43 pathology and suppressed the abnormal propagation of TDP-43. Therefore, we propose a potential therapeutic strategy to suppress transcriptional redundancy, which is the driving force of the pathological condition caused by the specific factors described above, in patients with ALS presenting with TDP-43 pathology. An ALS animal model exhibiting TDP-43 pathology without overexpression of exogenous TDP-43 should be developed to investigate the effect of alleviating the transcriptional redundancy of TARDBP.","2018","2021-12-01 19:40:28","2021-12-12 23:20:08","2021-12-01 19:40:28","28","","","12","","","Robustness and Vulnerability of the Autoregulatory System That Maintains Nuclear TDP-43 Levels","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","","/Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/RBPHDWU8/Sugai et al. - 2018 - Robustness and Vulnerability of the Autoregulatory.pdf","","::category genetics; ::category nuclear transport; ::category rna processing; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Morphological diversity and neuroanatomical distribution of pTDP-43 accumulations allowed classification of FTLD cases into at least four subtypes, which are correlated with clinical presentations and genetic causes. To understand the molecular basis of this heterogeneity, we developed SarkoSpin, a new method for biochemical isolation of pathological TDP-43. By combining SarkoSpin with mass spectrometry, we revealed proteins beyond TDP-43 that become abnormally insoluble in a disease subtype-specific manner. We show that pTDP-43 extracted from brain forms stable assemblies of distinct densities and morphologies that are associated with disease subtypes. Importantly, biochemically extracted pTDP-43 assemblies showed differential neurotoxicity and seeding that were correlated with disease duration of FTLD subjects. Our data are consistent with the notion that disease heterogeneity could originate from alternate pathological TDP-43 conformations, which are reminiscent of prion strains.","2019-01","2021-12-02 17:42:15","2021-12-12 23:20:08","","65-77","","1","22","","Nat Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30559480","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/EIWHP2GR/Laferrière et al. - 2019 - TDP-43 extracted from frontotemporal lobar degener.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30559480","::category clinical; ::category tdp-43 aggregation; ::category als","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, major advances have been made in identifying components of functionally distinct Beclin 1/class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes, in characterizing the molecular regulation of interactions between Beclin 1 and the autophagy inhibitors, Bcl-2/BcL-XL, and in uncovering a role for viral antagonists of Beclin 1 in viral pathogenesis. The rapidly growing list of components of the ‘Beclin 1 interactome’ supports a model in which autophagy, and potentially other membrane trafficking functions of Beclin 1, are governed by differential interactions with different binding partners in different physiological or pathophysiological contexts.","2010-04","2021-12-14 23:00:12","2021-12-14 23:01:27","2021-12-14 23:00:12","140-149","","2","22","","Curr Opin Cell Biol","","","","","","","","","","","","","PubMed Central","","PMID: 20097051 PMCID: PMC2854269","","; /Users/gordon/Zotero/storage/TZVQ35P8/He and Levine - 2010 - The Beclin 1 interactome.pdf","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2854269/","::category autophagy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Method As part of the ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD; U19 AG063911) protocol, investigators at 19 centers in North America will enroll 2100 participants with FTLD over the next 5 years beginning in early 2020. Result As of 1/20/20, the ARTFL/LEFFTDS (A/L) Consortium had enrolled 1832 participants, including 850 in kindreds with familial FTLD (239 associated with mutations in MAPT, 192 in GRN, 370 in C9orf72, 4 with mutations in both GRN and C9orf72, and 45 with a mutation in a different gene or no mutation in any known FTLD-associated gene). Over 500 participants have undergone 2 or more annual visits to date. MRI has been performed in 1105. Biofluid samples have also been collected, with blood (DNA, plasma, serum, mRNA, PBMC) in 1413 and CSF in 303. Over 60 manuscripts using A/L data or samples have been published to date. Five clinical trials involving A/L and ALLFTD participants are in progress or planned. The longitudinal arm in ALLFTD will enroll 500 of existing A/L and 600 future participants for annual assessments with similar methodology to A/L. An additional 1000 FTLD patients will undergo focused one-time clinical evaluations and biofluid collection. Conclusion The data/samples from already-enrolled and planned participants in ALLFTD and findings published to date underscore the utility of evaluating FTLD subjects. The absence of identifiable mutations in some with familial FTLD suggests that other genes are yet to be discovered. ALLFTD data will inform clinical trial design, and many participants will be eligible for future trials. The key data and samples in ALLFTD are available to interested investigators worldwide.
